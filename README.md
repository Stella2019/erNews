## This is a journal of all the installation I did through out this project
## (Development use only)

1. install [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
2. install [materialize](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html)
3. install [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)
4. install [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

* To start either client or server by itself: `npm start`
* In script section of client/package.json. Except `npm start`, all other command need to do it with `run`, 
for example: `npm run build` to build the react project.
