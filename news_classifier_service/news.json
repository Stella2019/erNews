the end of the parliamentary term.\n\nThis would be achieved by ruling out increases to the standard 20% rate of VAT, personal national insurance contributions and income tax rates for those earning under £80,000.\n\nHowever, he will say those earning more than £80,000 would have to pay more, without giving specific details.\n\nAt the moment, those earning more than £150,000 a year pay 45% tax on earnings above that level.\n\n\"The choice at this election is very clear on tax as there is currently only one party which is committing not to raise taxes on middle and low earners,\" he will say.\n\n\"The Tories are the party of tax handouts for the super-rich and big corporations.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Mr McDonnell will say working families have borne the brunt of austerity\n\nMr McDonnell will contrast the certainty around Labour's plans with what he says is obfuscation from the Conservatives.\n\n\"Every time Theresa May and the Conservatives are asked whether they are planning tax increases if they are re-elected on 8 June, they run and hide,\" he will say.\n\nLabour's spending commitments so far include:\n\nRecruiting 10,000 new police officers\n\nGiving NHS workers a pay rise of more than 1%\n\nReinstating training bursaries for student nurses\n\nBringing back the educational maintenance and carers allowances\n\nRestoring student grants\n\nThe majority of these, it says, will be covered by the reversal of cuts to corporation, capital gains and inheritance taxes.\n\nTory rebellion\n\nThe Conservatives are not expected to confirm their own plans until their manifesto launch later this month.\n\nMr Hammond abandoned proposals in March's Budget to increase national insurance contributions for the self-employed following a Tory rebellion, with MPs claiming the move breached its 2015 manifesto.\n\nDuring the coalition years, the focus of Conservative policy was steady increases in the personal tax allowance, the point at which people start paying income tax.\n\nThe threshold rose to £11,500 last month and is due to increase to £12,000 by 2020.\n\nAfter winning the 2015 election, the Conservatives also raised the level at which people start paying income tax at 40% - which has now reached £45,000 - to address the growing number of middle earners being pulled into the higher-rate bracket.\n\n'Gaping holes'\n\nThe Taxpayers Alliance campaign group said Labour's plans \"sounded good\" but there were \"gaping holes\" which could potentially allow it to increase employers' national insurance contributions and VAT on zero-rated items such as medicines.\n\nRaising income tax for those earning more than £80,000 would require \"very significant\" changes to tax thresholds, it said.\n\n\"A better way for the parties to demonstrate they are on the side of taxpayers would be to pledge to cut the overall tax burden and leave more money in the pockets of those who earned it,\" said its chief executive John O'Connell.\n\nFor the Conservatives, Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said: \"Jeremy Corbyn will have to raise taxes because his nonsensical economic ideas don't add up and he'll make a mess of the Brexit negotiations.\"\n\nThe Lib Dems have pledged to put 1p on income tax to pay for increased health spending.\n\nIts Treasury spokeswoman, Susan Kramer, said: \"John McDonnell has no credible plan for the future of our economy and no guarantee to employers that they won't be hit with a jobs tax.\"","author":"BBC News","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T21:00:03.000Z"},"source":"bbc-news","urlToImage":"https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7E25/production/_95939223_streetshot.jpg","class":"Technology","digest":"hvLPGJwNiM34lv+wki/9hQ==\n"}

About nine gigabytes of data were posted by an anonymous user.\n\nMr Macron's En Marche movement said internal campaign documents, including emails and financial data, had been taken in an \"act of massive, co-ordinated hacking\".\n\n\"The leaked files were obtained several weeks ago by hacking personal and professional email accounts of several officials of the movement,\" it said in a statement.\n\nHow did the leaks spread?\n\nThe hashtag #MacronLeaks appeared on Twitter on an account used by a US alt-right figure on Friday afternoon - and was reportedly retweeted 87 times in the first five minutes, suggesting the use of automated bots to spread the information faster.\n\nWithin 90 minutes, the information had caught the attention of prominent supporters of Marine Le Pen and was further spread by bots.\n\nSome three-and-a-half hours after the initial tweet, #MacronLeaks had been used some 47,000 times and the prominent Wikileaks account played a key role in publicising the hashtag.\n\nWho might be responsible?\n\nUnclear. The Macron camp has not blamed any specific party but said the hack clearly aimed to damage it and undermine French democracy,\n\nIt compared it to the leak of Democratic Party emails in last year's US presidential election that was blamed on Russian hackers.\n\nWikileaks, which published those emails, posted a link to the Macron documents on Twitter but implied it was not responsible.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart.

If they win both games they will stay up.\n\nHull are away at Crystal Palace, who are four points above the relegation zone after a 5-0 defeat at Manchester City, on 14 May before hosting second-placed Tottenham on the last day.\n\nPalace's final match of the season is at Manchester United, who are unbeaten in their past 24 league games.\n\nHull result inspires the Swans\n\nFor the Swans, a passionate fanbase turned into a delirious one before a ball was even kicked in south Wales, after Sunderland's victory over Hull.\n\nThat lifted a boisterous Liberty Stadium, but it took almost half an hour before Swansea created a big opportunity in a cagey contest.\n\nWhen they did, they took it expertly, Llorente heading home from close range after Ayew's twisting run and deflected cross fell perfectly.\n\nHolgate then produced an outstanding challenge to deny Mawson, with a Jagielka block also denying Martin Olsson's effort from an acute angle.\n\nSwansea continued to carve out the better chances, Ayew's volley with the outside of his foot hitting the post, and it was not until the 66th minute that Lukasz Fabianski was seriously tested by Lukaku's 20-yard shot.\n\nThe hosts spurned further chances through Llorente and Fer. It might have cost Swansea at the death when their former skipper Ashley Williams was inches away from heading home, but he couldn't quite convert from Kevin Mirallas' flick-on.\n\nEverton eyes on next season\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Swansea defended for their lives - Koeman\n\nEverton stay seventh, two points behind sixth-placed Arsenal but having played three games more than the Gunners.\n\nThe Toffees have the feel of a club already building for next term.\n\nRoss Barkley, whose future in unclear as his contract runs down, was dropped by Ronald Koeman as was loanee Enner Valencia.\n\nBarkley's introduction at half-time was evidence that Everton had lacked panache in the final third, with Fabianski entirely untroubled before the break.\n\nEverton had won eight of their past 11 visits to Swansea, but not even returning Wales captain Williams - whose every touch was jeered by a section of the home fans - could inspire the visitors.\n\nMan of the Match - Fernando Llorente (Swansea City)\n\nFernando Llorente was not only the match-winner and a constant threat, he also made a big impact defensively, getting his head to several Everton set-pieces.\n\n'Hull result gave us a lift' - what they said\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Hull defeat gave Swans a lift - Clement\n\nSwansea boss Paul Clement: \"It is one of my proudest moments. What a fantastic, gritty performance. It was so important we got that result after what happened at Hull.\n\n\"We have hit some form both offensively and especially defensively. We have played against really good opposition and seven points from three games is a fantastic tally.\n\n\"It gave us a lift before the game knowing that result had gone in our favour, we knew if we did something special we could get out of the relegation zone.\n\n\"We really defended well.\"\n\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman: \"It was not good enough. The difference is one goal, we had maybe more ball possession, it was difficult to create open chances.\n\n\"The final part, we had to be a little bit more aggressive in the box. The problem is in the last few weeks to create chances - we don't score in the last three games.\n\n\"In my opinion, seventh position is a good position and next Friday is important to give the fans a win they deserve.\"\n\n'End of season goal drought' - the stats\n\nEverton have failed to score in their past three Premier League games for the first time since a four-game drought in April 2006.\n\nSwansea have taken seven points from their past three league games after picking up just one in the six before that.\n\nThe Toffees have lost an away league game in Wales for the first time in their past 11 games there (W5 D5), since a 1-0 defeat to Cardiff at Ninian Park in December 1956.\n\nThis is Fernando Llorente's best goal haul in a league season (13) since 2013-14 (16 with Juventus).\n\nJordan Ayew has provided an assist in three of his past six Premier League games, this after failing to assist in any of his first 36 in the competition.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nSwansea visit relegated Sunderland in their penultimate match of the season on Saturday, 13 May (15:00 BST), while Everton host 15th-placed Watford next Friday (19:45 BST).","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T19:13:33.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/16DD5/production/_95935639_hi039335190.jpg","class":"Sports","digest":"C8rXP59lMr61fVI0MKNNNQ==\n"}

They went 1-0 up and we had to regroup, but we did and came back at them.\n\n\"It was all positive in the dressing room at half-time. The shackles were off and there was no pressure so make yourself heroes.\n\n\"We needed to get the fans onside and we did with our performance. I have learned if you give the fans everything on the pitch they will stick by you.\n\n\"We got relegated but the fans stayed behind and clapped us off they showed their appreciation but ultimately is that right or wrong?\n\n\"The players have been magnificent in the past two weeks.

He reiterated his view that society at large benefits from both economic efficiency and free trade, often at the expense of individual workers who struggle to find new jobs.\n\nHe spoke of the plight of former employees at a Berkshire textile operation in New Bedford, Massachusetts, who lost their work to competition from cheaper locations decades ago. Buffett said such shifts help millions of people by providing necessities at a lower cost.\n\n“Massive trade should be -- and is actually -- enormously beneficial to both the U.S. and the world,” he said. “Greater productivity will benefit the world in a general way, but to be roadkill, to be the textile worker in New Bedford” is a painful experience, he added. “It would be no fun to go through life and say I’m doing this for the greater good, and so that shoes or underwear was all for 5 percent less.”\n\nTrump’s View\n\nYour cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter.\n\nBuffett, 86, said that gross domestic product per person in the U.S. is six times higher now than when he was born, reiterating his optimism about the nation’s ability to generate wealth. That contrasts with the view of Donald Trump during his successful presidential campaign, when he said that the U.S. was ripped off by free-trade agreements. The president spoke in his inaugural speech in January about “ American carnage” where “rusted-out factories” are “scattered like tombstones.”\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent in April, the lowest since before the financial crisis, according to Labor Department figures Friday. Still, Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, said many jobs pay too little.\n\n“We need to bring back the manufacturing jobs that pay a lot,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview Friday. “We need to bring back the service jobs that pay a lot.”\n\nBuffett often calls on the U.S. to do more to help the working class and has said the tax system is tilted to benefit rich people like him, a point he pressed Saturday. He also said it is up to the president, whoever is in office, to serve as an “educator-in-chief” and explain how free trade helps the country in the long run.\n\n“Beyond that, we have to have policies that take care of the people that become the roadkill in the process,” Buffett said. “We have got the resources.”","author":"Katherine Chiglinsky, Noah Buhayar, Jordyn Holman","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T23:29:24.026Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iy_c_DlEIjKc/v0/1200x800.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"71WSxq+Z3lOAEwR/5GT4ig==\n"}

And I think its almost untalked about compared to the severity that we’re witnessing.”\n\nScott Gottlieb, Trump’s pick to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said in his confirmation hearing that tackling the opioid epidemic should be the agency’s highest priority. The crisis “has staggering human consequences,” Gottlieb said.\n\nBaum said the cuts proposed by the Office of Management and Budget will make it harder for the commission to achieve its goals.

The country’s electoral control commission, in a statement, said there was a “significant amount of data” leaked, and requested that websites, social media and news organizations refrain from disseminating details of it in accordance with French election law. Rallies, interviews and opinion polls are all legally banned from midnight Friday, to give voters time to think about their choice.\n\nBecause of those restrictions, it wasn’t clear how many voters would know about the attack or contents of the materials prior to casting ballots. News of the hacking complaint was picked up by print media including Le Monde newspaper and Agence France-Presse and debated on social media, though broadcasters remained largely silent on the matter Saturday.\n\nAfter a stormy campaign marked by scandal, virulence and terrorism, voters face a choice Sunday between centrist pro-European Union Macron and his far-right anti-euro rival, Marine Le Pen.\n\nGet the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily.\n\nMacron, 39, and Le Pen, 48, knocked out both the Socialist Party and the center-right Republicans in the April 23 first round -- defeating establishment parties that had governed France since Charles de Gaulle ushered in the Fifth Republic in 1958. Whoever wins, the first round of voting revealed a nation deeply divided, with about 45 percent of votes being cast for candidates wanting to remake the nation’s ties with the EU, risking financial chaos.\n\n“There is sort of electoral neurosis,” said Dominique Reynie, a politics professor at the Sciences Po institute Paris. “Many of those who go to vote in the final round will find themselves forced to back someone who they normally wouldn’t support.”\n\nMacron was well ahead in the polls at the end of Friday. If he wins, French voters will have broken with populist momentum that put the U.K. on track to leave the European Union and carried Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nYet Le Pen posted her party’s biggest-ever vote in the first ballot, highlighting dissatisfaction by conquering the depressed towns of industrial decline in the north and east, and the conservative heartlands of the south. France’s unemployment rate remains stuck at 10 percent, roughly double the levels in the U.K. and Germany -- a major challenge to the next president.\n\n“To succeed in terms of jobs is of the essence if we want to respond to this anger,” former European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet told Bloomberg Television Friday.\n\nVoter anger, however, was not what dominated the final hours before campaigning stopped. As Macron’s team said Friday that fake information had been mixed into a trove, Le Pen aide Florian Philippot suggested that the media had avoided scrutinizing Macron thoroughly.\n\n“Will the #Macronleaks uncover things that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?” Philippot said in a tweet just before the blackout began. “Frightening democratic shipwreck.”\n\nVoting in the runoff starts in mainland France Sunday at 8 a.m. local time, and results will be released starting at 8 p.m.","author":"Mark Deen, John Follain","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T15:32:39.382Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwquW2BYmXic/v0/1200x800.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"gd2dstrx7I0KiquWWaZU2Q==\n"}

Bush and Barack Obama used while in office, included language on issues from the use of medical marijuana to funding for historically black colleges and universities.\n\nTrump also suggested he may ignore congressional requirements for advance notice before taking a range of foreign policy and military actions.\n\nThe president said his constitutional prerogatives supersede the restrictions Congress placed on him as a condition for funding government operations -- a comment that raised eyebrows about the lengths to which the White House may be going to consolidate power.\n\nSteve Bell, a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said Trump’s signing statement signaled a desire to usurp power from the legislative branch.\n\n“It is the constitutional prerogative of the Congress to spend money and to put limitations on spending,” Bell, a former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee and an aide to former Republican Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, said by phone. “This is an extremely broad assertion of executive branch power over the purse.”\n\nMarijuana, Colleges\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump signaled he may ignore a congressional ban on interfering with state medical marijuana laws.\n\nHe also said he would treat a program that helps historically black colleges get low-cost construction loans, “in a manner consistent with the requirement to afford equal protection of the law” under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe comment was interpreted to mean he may defund the decades-old program, and drew a rebuke from members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nJeff Sessions addresses law enforcement members on March 31. Photographer: Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images\n\n“Trump signaled that he may not implement construction funding for historically black colleges and universities due to supposed constitutional concerns,” Representatives John Conyers of Michigan and Cedric Richmond of Louisiana said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n“Trump’s statement is not only misinformed factually, it is not grounded in any serious constitutional analysis,” they said.\n\nThe United Negro College Fund said it had received “informal assurance” from the White House that there had been no policy change but urged an official clarification of the statement.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has vowed to crack down on marijuana in various forms, and has dismissed arguments for its medical use as “desperate.”\n\n“I reject the idea that we’re going to be better placed if we have more marijuana,” Sessions said in a speech to law-enforcement officials in March. “It’s not a healthy substance, particularly for young people.”\n\nTwenty-nine states and the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico now allow for medical marijuana use, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nTrump singled out a provision in the spending bill that says funds cannot be used to block states from implementing medical marijuana laws. “I will treat this provision consistently with my constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” he said.\n\nMaking a Statement\n\nObama also occasionally released signing statements objecting to congressional restrictions on his authority. The White House described Trump’s signing statement as routine, but didn’t indicate whether the president planned to take action to defy Congressional restrictions.\n\nBell said Trump’s stance on the medical marijuana provision in the bill was at odds with the 10th Amendment, which protects states from federal overreach.\n\nTim Shaw, a senior policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that the president is bound by the language in the spending bill that now bears his signature.\n\n“Part of the argument here in this signing statement is that he has the constitutional requirement to execute the law,” Shaw said in an interview. “But this is one of those laws, and Congress has the ultimate authority over funds getting spent.’’","author":"Toluse Olorunnipa","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T23:20:13.687Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/idYWRsLaZ.00/v0/1200x780.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"0KYt4J2p0vsvu4+pwFF4zw==\n"}

(AP) -- Always Dreaming splashed through the slop to win the Kentucky Derby by 2 3/4 lengths on Saturday, giving trainer Todd Pletcher and jockey John Velazquez their second victories in the race but their first together.\n\nPletcher and Velazquez have teamed up often over the years and are the sport's leading money winners. On their own, they were a combined 2 for 63 coming into America's greatest race.\n\nTogether, they were unbeatable on a cool and rainy at Churchill Downs.\n\nSent off at 9-2 odds, Always Dreaming made it the fifth straight year that a Derby favorite has won, the longest such stretch since the 1970s.\n\nAlways Dreaming was followed across the finish line by a pair of longshots: 33-1 Lookin At Lee and 40-1 Battle of Midway.\n\nAlways Dreaming ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:03.59 and paid $11.40, $7.20 and $5.80.\n\nLookin At Lee returned $26.60 and $18.20, while Battle of Midway was another five lengths back in third and paid $20.80 to show.\n\nPletcher won his first Derby in 2010 with Super Saver; Velazquez won the following year with Animal Kingdom.\n\nGoing into his 17th Derby, Pletcher saddled the post-time favorite for the first time. Much had been made of his 1 for 45 Derby record. Altogether, he's had 48 runners, tying mentor D. Wayne Lukas for the most in Derby history.\n\n\"It's becoming a little more respectable now,\" Pletcher said.\n\nVelazquez used his colt's speed out of the gate to get good position early in a chaotic start that saw several horses, including Classic Empire, get sandwiched. He steered Always Dreaming into an ideal trip behind pacesetter State of Honor, with mud flying in all directions on a track that resembled creamy peanut butter.\n\nOn the final turn, Always Dreaming took command as State of Honor faded. Despite chasing a quick early pace, Always Dreaming was still full of run. No other horses threatened him down the stretch and Velazquez furiously pumped his right arm as they crossed the finish line.\n\nPletcher had his hands full in the days leading up to the Derby when the colt's behavior was less than a dream.\n\nHe was fractious in the morning, refusing to relax.\n\n\"I was nervous watching him gallop,\" the trainer said.\n\nTurns out the dark brown colt knew best.\n\nHe channeled his aggression into a determined effort on a track turned into goo by on and off rain before the race.\n\n\"I think he really came in here and knew it was game time, and he was ready to go,\" Pletcher said. \"The most important thing to do is bring the best horse to the Derby, and that's what we were able to do.\"\n\nAlways Dreaming earned his fourth straight victory, proving that his five-length win in the Florida Derby was no fluke.\n\nBy winning the Derby, he accomplished something his sire Bodemeister couldn't do. Bodemeister finished second in the 2012 race.\n\nThe victory was worth $1,635,800.\n\nAlways Dreaming's primary ownership is comprised of Brooklyn Boyz Stables and Teresa Viola, whose Brooklyn-born husband Vincent owns the NHL's Florida Panthers.\n\nClassic Empire finished fourth, followed by Practical Joke, Tapwrit, Gunnevera, McCraken, Gormley and Irish War Cry. Hence was 11th, followed by Untrapped, Girvin, one-eyed Patch, J Boys Echo, Sonneteer, Fast And Accurate, Irap, and State of Honor.\n\nPletcher also trains Tapwrit and Patch.\n\nThunder Snow, the Dubai-based entry, didn't finish. He broke poorly out of the starting gate and began bucking. He was caught by the outrider and he walked back to the barn on his own.","author":"","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T23:18:15.484Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iJOjngpeg1IE/v0/1200x800.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"wBreWWhiehlUwFy2nMu+BA==\n"}

It’s a hotel lobby as a symbol of this presidency.\n\nIt was a Tuesday night at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, and the marble-floored, chandelier-covered, gold-trimmed lobby was buzzing. On a cushy chair by the bar, former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo was explaining why he wears a skull ring on the middle finger of his right hand and a bracelet on his left.\n\nThe jewelry’s origin story included a Ukrainian murder, love, a French circus, hiding out from the mob, an Indian ashram, the Rolling Stones, and a campaign to get out the vote in Russia, but he wasn’t worried about being overheard by enemies.\n\nCaputo’s skull ring. Photographer: Max Abelson/Bloomberg\n\n“If you go to a bar on Capitol Hill, you go to a restaurant downtown, it’s somebody else’s place,” Caputo said. “This is Trump Land. It’s not even a neutral zone. It’s not even like no man’s land. This is Trump Land. People from the campaign, people from the administration, feel comfortable coming here.”\n\nSpending almost 50 straight hours inside Donald Trump’s second-most important building on Pennsylvania Avenue—from late morning on April 25 to the early afternoon two days later—shows why it’s the perfect symbol of his presidency. The hotel lobby is drawing Trump fans who cheered his promises to drain Washington’s swamp, along with the power players who know how to swim in it. Because much of their money will end up in Trump’s pocket, and the government he controls leased the building to him, few places present more potential conflicts for the president.\n\nThat week, Trump was barreling toward the end of his first 100 days in office by cobbling together his one-page tax overhaul, racing to revive a health-care bill, and avoiding a government shutdown. Nothing seemed amiss inside his 263-room hotel. The lobby, with its Swarovski chandeliers and glass-topped atrium, is bright even on a bleak Tuesday afternoon. On one side, tourists sat below a four-story U.S. flag, flipping through a bar menu that offers an $8 glass of milk, a $100 vodka cocktail with caviar, and one ounce of Hungarian wine in a crystal spoon for $140. The corn nuts, with truffle oil, are free.\n\nThe lobby and bar at the Trump hotel. Photographer: Scott Frances\n\nOn the other side, BLT Prime’s $110 porterhouse for two can be accompanied by a $16 tarragon lobster fondue. The mezzanine, where the president has eaten well-done steak with ketchup, is perfect for watching people downstairs. Trump has visited the hotel at least five times this year, more than once a month.\n\nBelow the lobby, a spa offers $340 couples massages, something called “curated rituals,” and, for $225 in the skin studio, a “diamond whitening treatment.” The place is named for White House aide Ivanka Trump, and so is a suite that costs about $940 a night.\n\nBy an elevator Tuesday evening, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was cradling a small dog in his arms. The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner, who would present Trump’s tax overhaul the next day, went up at about 10 p.m. A grandmother from Florida on a trip to see a friend was eating fries by the bar. She raised her arms to praise Trump’s renovation of a 118-year-old former post office, a project that cost about $200 million. She said it made her feel hope for the U.S.\n\nRepublican elephants adorned the socks of a tourist from Nashville, Tennessee, and the cuff links of banking lobbyist Aaron Cutler, who arrived the next morning at 10. His office at Hogan Lovells is nearby.\n\nChandelier in lobby. Photographer: Max Abelson/Bloomberg\n\n“It’s a nice place to go when you want to have a conversation with somebody and you don’t want somebody on top of you listening in,” said Cutler, a senior policy adviser for Eric Cantor when the Republican was House Majority Leader. “There’s a bird,” Cutler said, spotting what looked like a sparrow inside the lobby. It was there the day before, too, hopping on a cream-colored carpet by one of the bar’s cream-colored armchairs.\n\nWhile Cutler drank a mid-morning cola, Boris Epshteyn was on the mezzanine eating breakfast in a three-piece suit at a table for two. Epshteyn, raised in Soviet Russia, left as a Trump press official this year and became a political analyst. He returned to the hotel that evening, when important people were coming and going with entourages. Campaign ally and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was accompanied by four people and his monogrammed luggage. He stopped to examine a cart with five bottles of Glenfarclas whisky and smiled.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy went up to the mezzanine, where the California congressman lifted his left hand with his palm held vertical, handing out a crisp wave and crisper smile. Downstairs at BLT Prime, South Dakota Senator John Thune sat with his tie tucked into his shirt between two buttons. When the other three men at his table got up to welcome someone, Thune, chairman of the Commerce Committee and the Republican Conference, stayed snugly seated.\n\nGiuliani, who’s working for an Iranian-Turkish gold trader accused of circumventing U.S. sanctions, crossed the lobby again. This time he was accompanied by a woman wearing what looked like a blue fur.\n\nThat week, Noah Bookbinder sent a letter to senators about the hotel. The former federal prosecutor, who heads Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, has a few bones to pick. As he sees it, the U.S. Constitution bars presidents from receiving anything of value from foreign officials without the consent of Congress, a problem now that Bahrain, Kuwait, and Azerbaijan have held events here. Plus, he says the 60-year lease Trump signed with the government in 2013 bans elected officials from being on it. The General Services Administration said in March that it sees no problem, and Bookbinder’s letter asked senators to investigate why. His group sued the president over the hotel in January.\n\nTrump still has a stake in the project, though he put it in a trust controlled by his adult sons, who now also run the Trump Organization. His lawyers said he will donate hotel profits from foreign governments to the Treasury, without detailing how that would work.\n\nTrump and members of his family at the hotel’s opening ceremony on Oct. 26, 2016. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg\n\nTourists seemed more concerned about finding the clock tower. Some stood in the main elevators, which won’t work without a key card, before being told they had to leave the hotel, walk three-quarters of the way around it, past the Environmental Protection Agency and the Internal Revenue Service, step through a corridor, take one elevator, walk some more, and take another. After soaking in the views of Washington, including the White House about five blocks away, they exit through an unfinished hallway museum that says the area used to be known as Murder Bay, on account of the bodies found dead here.\n\nOn Thursday, a tourist with a huge Trump button on his short-sleeve shirt ate with his family on the mezzanine. Former Bear Stearns economist David Malpass, tapped to be a Treasury undersecretary, sat downstairs with Judy Shelton, an economic adviser on Trump’s campaign team who supports a return to the gold standard.\n\nThat fits the hotel, where restaurant receipts come with gold-colored paper clips. Upstairs, the hotel bathrooms have gold-colored door handles, towel racks, soap dishes, faucets, showerheads, mouthwash bottle caps, tissue holders, mirror frames, wall art, light fixtures, trash cans, toilet paper dispensers, and backup toilet paper holders.\n\nPresidential Suite master bathroom. Source: Trump Hotels\n\nIt was easy to book a room for about $600 a night that week on a few days’ notice, even when the Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons hotels were sold out. The service was smiley, the marble shiny, and pillows plentiful. The real world only intervened thanks to some wilting flowers and uncleared dessert dishes in the lobby.\n\nTuesday night, when Caputo was sitting by the bar, telling the story of how he met his wife while working on a Ukrainian political campaign, then followed her to France and India, the former Trump adviser said the hotel reminded him of a particular country.\n\n“Russia,” said Caputo, who did work for a subsidiary of state-owned Gazprom and a Boris Yeltsin campaign. “They have buildings that are 900 years older than this,” he added, before walking across the marble floor to eat a steak.\n\n—With assistance from Kathryn Glass and Shannon Pettypiece.","author":"Max Abelson","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-03T09:00:07.377Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iy18.SuFN.lU/v0/-1x-1.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"b58uTfGo1pQgDYZKWA2G8Q==\n"}

By Simon van Zuylen-Wood • May 4, 2017 Source: RT/Youtube.com\n\nAbout 17 million U.S. households subscribe to Spectrum, the television provider formerly known as Time Warner Cable. Those in New York City, whether they know it or not, also subscribe to the Russian-funded news outlet RT. Customers can locate it by scrolling past the Chinese Channel and the Africa Channel and into the triple digits, until RT’s radioactive-green logo appears on screen.\n\nLike any 24-hour cable news outlet, RT has good days and excruciatingly slow days. April 24, the day after the first round of France’s presidential election, figured at least to be interesting. Russia was being accused of trying to tip the race in favor of the right-wing nationalist Marine Le Pen, and RT, if you believe the U.S. intelligence community, is at the vanguard of Russia’s soft-power strategy. So around noon that Monday, sitting at home in Brooklyn, I flip to Spectrum channel 218.\n\nThe coverage is being anchored from a raft on the Seine by two impassive, middle-aged Brits. The broadcast is live, but the hosts mainly introduce prerecorded segments from RT’s Paris bureau. Much of France has been exhaling at the election result, which saw the centrist Emmanuel Macron finish ahead of Le Pen. On RT, the mood is dour. One segment, set to menacing, Jaws-style strings, depicts violent outbursts from the previous night. There’s fire and tear gas. A young man kicks ineffectually at a glass door. “They’re not happy with anybody,” a reporter intones.\n\nNext up, a bit titled “France of Rich \u0026 France of Poor,” which contrasts a workaday pro-Le Pen town with a snobby Paris suburb. “Enough of this boutique land,” a correspondent says.

After dissing Macron as a “very, very unknown 39-year-old boy who has basically married his mother”—his wife is 25 years his elder—Atkinson goes off-message, accusing Russia of “doing an awful lot of meddling, don’t you think?” The anchors look at their feet.\n\nAt 4 p.m., RT hands off to RT America, its Washington, D.C.-based operation, which offers its regular mixture of anodyne headline news and niche opinion shows: Watching the Hawks, an occasionally paranoid show featuring the sons of Jesse Ventura and Oliver Stone; Larry King interviewing Mario Batali. When the feed returns to Paris at 8 p.m., a correspondent bats down talk of Russian electoral interference, above a chyron that reads, “Media overwhelmingly back Macron despite Le Pen only 2% away.”\n\nAll in a day’s coverage for RT, which began in 2005 as Russia Today, a Moscow-based, English-language competitor to Al Jazeera and BBC World News. But even as it added foreign bureaus and its staff increased to more than 2,000, its reach remained limited to a niche on the anti-Establishment Left. Journalists condescended to it. Politicians and cable operators shunned it.\n\nWhere else on cable news could a 27-year-old inveigh against U.S. imperialism on a nightly basis?\n\nDuring last year’s U.S. election, as evidence mounted that Russia had orchestrated cyberhacks to boost Donald Trump’s candidacy, RT and its aggressively anti-Hillary Clinton coverage became harder to ignore. The network also made news for a 10th anniversary dinner it hosted in Moscow in late 2015, at which former counterintelligence official and Trump campaign adviser Michael Flynn spoke for a $45,000 fee and sat at Vladimir Putin’s table. In January the CIA, FBI, and NSA jointly released a declassified report alleging that RT had sought to undermine the “U.S.-led liberal democratic order.” And in March, Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, introduced a bill in the Senate to investigate whether RT America and the Russian government coordinated to “spread misinformation.” (“They’ll soon start shooting our journalists at the squares,” RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan responded.)\n\nAll this sounds serious—much more serious than any of the frankly terrible TV I watched. RT’s coverage of U.S. politics, the war in Syria, and the cozy Trump-Russia relationship may well offer a window into the Kremlin’s PR strategy, but if the network’s largely young, left-wing journalists work on behalf of the Russian state, they hardly seem aware of it. Mostly they’re getting into Twitter feuds with CNN’s Jake Tapper and, they will quietly admit, looking for better jobs. If, as the authorities would have it, RT is executing a successful hearts-and-minds campaign to undermine the liberal democratic order, the liberal democratic order may be more vulnerable than we thought.\n\nBy the time Putin assumed Russia’s presidency in 1999, the country had developed a relatively robust post-Soviet media. Gradually he wrested every major outlet from private control and blanketed the airwaves with Kremlin PR. With the country also enjoying an oil and gas boom, Putin became more popular than ever. Abroad, not so much.\n\nEnter Russia Today, which was developed by former Russian press minister Mikhail Lesin as an urbane foreign counterpart to domestic telly. The network would imitate the look of Western cable news while disrupting narratives critical of Russia—or, as Putin later put it, while breaking “the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on the global information streams.” Kremlin-funded, but in theory editorially independent, Russia Today was staffed by telegenic Brits and perfectly bilingual Muscovites. Its annual budget started at $30 million and increased 10-fold over the next five years. (By comparison, the BBC World Service’s annual budget is about $450 million; the federally funded Voice of America somehow spends $220 million.)\n\nMost cable channels receive fees from broadcasters for the right to air them, but it wasn’t clear that Russia Today would draw enough viewers to make the prospect attractive to the likes of Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Cable. So the network paid for access to the largest U.S. cable markets—the same strategy Rupert Murdoch followed when Fox News was in its infancy—and an impossible number of random hotels around the country. It soon became clear, though, that nobody outside Russia cared to watch coverage of its domestic affairs. So in 2009, Simonyan, a wunderkind Russian reporter, pivoted to global news. She created Spanish- and Arabic-language bureaus out of Moscow, plus standalone operations in London and Washington, and dropped “Russia” from the channel’s name, rebranding it RT.\n\nThe shift created a new problem. During the Soviet era, Radio Moscow had pushed socialist ideology abroad, but none of the hallmarks of Putin’s Russia—he-man nationalism, Orthodox Christianity, cronyism—were so easily exportable. “Russia doesn’t have a coherent ideology to project,” says Alexey Kovalev, a Moscow journalist and media critic who formerly worked for the state news agency, RIA Novosti. “The only thing we can do is bring others on our level, to tell everybody that Western values don’t mean anything.”\n\nSource: Youtube\n\nIn 2009, McCann Erickson created a slogan for the channel: “Question More.” Rather than foster a message of its own, RT would prick holes in everyone else’s. The next year it launched an offshoot, RT America, on the second floor of a building three blocks from the White House.\n\nRT’s funding structure helped ensure that any political ties to Russia wouldn’t be subject to special scrutiny from the American government. The network was incorporated in Russia as a nonprofit organization, TV-Novosti, which then transferred funds to a separate, U.S.-incorporated company, RTTV Inc. This structure allowed it to bypass the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires entities representing foreign political interests to disclose themselves as such. But it also contributed to a chaotic, ad hoc corporate environment. A Maryland-based Russian who owned RTTV early on pleaded guilty in 2013 to tax fraud after stashing more than $1 million of the company’s money in a personal account. Control was transferred to its news director, Mikhail Solodovnikov, a former reporter for a Russian TV outlet.\n\nA lot of RT America’s early coverage was absurd and conspiratorial, promoted by YouTube headlines such as “Obama an alien president?” A former employee told me she was asked in her job interview how she would cover the annual Bilderburg Group conference in the Netherlands, long a shadowy boogeything to the antiglobalist set. But what RT America lacked in editorial rigor it made up for in opportunity.\n\nAn emblematic early hire was Abby Martin, a pox-on-everybody iconoclast who’d caught RT’s attention for her freelance coverage of Occupy Wall Street. In 2012 she began hosting a nightly show, Breaking the Set. For her the appeal of RT America was editorial freedom; where else on cable news could a 27-year-old inveigh against U.S. imperialism on a nightly basis? “It was a huge space for radicals against the neoliberal Establishment,” she says. “I wouldn’t necessarily say this was my No. 1 choice, working for the Russian government to speak out against our policies. But in this abysmal media environment, it was really gratifying to be given this platform on an international stage.”\n\nHenry looked up from his phone, grinned, and said, “Making Russia great again—I love it”\n\nMartin had a six-figure social media following and did nothing if not “question more.” In 2013 she attacked MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow for mocking “truthers” who maintained the Sept. 11 attacks were an inside job. “Is it really so hard to believe the fact that Bush and his cabinet turned a blind eye to let the attacks happen, or even ensure that they happened?” she asked. RT also sought out far-left critics of U.S. foreign policy, who would reliably argue that Western critiques of Russian belligerence were hypocritical. These people ranged from random New Black Panthers and Chomskyite beardos to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who got a short-lived show. The Financial Times described the network’s nonstop anti-U.S. coverage as “whataboutism”—as in sure, Russia has problems, but what about the States?\n\nRT America’s coverage of issues such as mass incarceration and domestic surveillance wouldn’t have been out of place on Al Jazeera America or MSNBC. But the overarching aim of making the U.S. look unstable or undemocratic gave the productions a hyped-up, amateurish quality. Republicans and Democrats alike were portrayed as corporatist tools; during the 2012 election, RT America rallied behind Ron Paul.\n\nIt further marginalized itself with self-interested foreign coverage. In 2014, when Russia invaded Crimea, RT pushed the line that Ukraine was engaging in a “genocidal” massacre of civilians. Martin denounced Russian aggression on her show, and two days later one of her colleagues, Liz Wahl, resigned on air, saying she couldn’t work for a network that “whitewashes the actions of Putin.” But the incidents were more embarrassing to the network than threatening. (Martin left in 2015 and now hosts a show on a channel funded by the Venezuelan government.)\n\nIn 2016, RT America at last began proving its usefulness to the Russian government. The outlet remained as second-rate as ever, but during an election campaign governed by populist rage, anti-Establishment whataboutism had fresh appeal. RT America’s editorial staff appeared enamored of Bernie Sanders; the Kremlin was tempted by Trump. The result was a fire hose of negative Clinton coverage, with almost nightly segments about her private email server.\n\nAs Election Day drew near, a synergy developed between RT’s election coverage and Russia’s apparent hacking efforts. In July the channel aired a segment promising fresh Clinton campaign email revelations. “Julian Assange claims next leak will lead to arrest of Clinton,” read the chyron. The story was based on an interview Assange had given more than a month earlier in which he said he didn’t believe his batch of emails would yield an indictment. The promised emails never came, but Trump benefited just the same.\n\nJudging the reach of RT’s election coverage is tricky. The TV station is watched by so few people that Nielsen doesn’t bother to publish its ratings. (RT commissioned a study by market researcher Ipsos in 2016 that put total weekly U.S. viewership at 8 million, but it didn’t release the methodology.) And while RT has more total YouTube views than CNN or BBC America, leaked documents have shown its stats to be heavily inflated by random disaster footage that the network buys the rights to broadcast. Still, RT managed to set the pro-Trump agenda in the danker corners of the internet—its pro-Bashar al-Assad or anti-George Soros articles were reposted everywhere from breitbart.com to InfoWars to the neo-Nazi forum stormfront.org. The Assange clip was viewed more than 700,000 times; weeks before the election, pro-Trump websites and alt-right trolls were still using it to whip up readers.\n\nToward the end of the race, professional journalists and self-styled muckrakers began to trace Russian electoral interference to RT. The January U.S. intelligence report went further, devoting most of its declassified findings to RT’s critical coverage of U.S. affairs. A lot of people found such assertions laughable. In a blog post, the New Yorker’s Adrian Chen argued that one widely circulated independent study failed to distinguish between “explicit tools of the Russian state” and the “useful idiots” who did their bidding unwittingly. Masha Gessen, in a piece published on the New York Review of Books’ website a few weeks before Trump’s inauguration, mocked the government for casting RT America’s coverage of fracking and Occupy Wall Street as un-American subversion. The declassified report, she wrote, “suggests that the U.S. intelligence agencies’ Russia expertise is weak and throws into question their ability to process and present information.”\n\nAs if to prove Gessen’s point, the day after her piece was published, at a U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing covering “Russian Intelligence Activities,” Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) asked National Intelligence Director James Clapper, “Does RT get any of its broadcast into the United States?”\n\nClapper replied, “Yes it does, sir. It does, it’s very prevalent in Europe and lesser so—” He paused. “I think there’s an RT channel here.”\n\nWashington’s bemusement was on display in February at the Beltway ritual known as the Conservative Political Action Conference. Ed Schultz, a 63-year-old populist who once hosted a nightly opinion show on MSNBC and now anchors a news program on RT America, was appearing there for a panel on trade. In his new incarnation as an anchor for a Russian media outlet accused of subverting democracy, he drew a sizable crowd.\n\n“Full disclosure,” he began. “The Russians did not tell Hillary Clinton, ‘Don’t go to Wisconsin.’ ” He then praised the new president, whom he’d once openly scorned, for appealing to disaffected workers: “For years they thought the Democrats and the progressive movement was their friend. But wait a minute, the jobs left anyways. So a guy named Donald Trump comes up, who’s not bought and paid for by anybody, who pulls up in a 757 and says, ‘I care about your jobs.’ He ain’t fakin’ it. He’s successful.”\n\nIn a post-panel press scrum, a reporter suggested Schultz had become a mouthpiece for Putin. He replied, “The perception is that we’re propaganda, and we simply are not.” More journalists appeared. “I don’t believe that Russia is the enemy of the United States,” he said. “I think this is all big paranoia.”\n\nEventually he extricated himself, and we walked together toward the exit. On our way out, he spied Fox News’s Ed Henry standing alone outside a ballroom. Relieved to see a familiar face, Schultz loped over to greet Henry, saying, “The one. The only. There’s only one Fast Eddie!” Henry looked up from his phone, grinned, and said, “Making Russia great again—I love it.”\n\nRT America collects discarded pundits. Schultz signed on after MSNBC canceled his nightly show in 2015. In 2013, Larry King, now 83, inked a deal to air his independently produced interview shows, Larry King Now and Politicking, on RT America. (He occasionally throws shade at the outlet to assert his editorial freedom.) Ex-Minnesota Governor and conspiracy buff Jesse Ventura has hosted a show and will return later this year with a second. Such hires may seem desperate, but they’re in a sense on-brand for an operation that pits itself relentlessly against the mainstream media.\n\nSchultz almost never grants interviews anymore, precisely to avoid unpleasant grillings about his new job, but as we rode back to his office in a company SUV, he told me a story. After the 2010 BP PLC oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, he’d gone down to report for MSNBC on the environmental toll. “The PR people at BP were calling us every night,” he said. “They just didn’t want to accept the fact that we were telling the truth.” The implication was that at RT, there are no ads or shareholders, and thus no corporate pressure to soft-pedal stories about oil spills. (Neither MSNBC nor BP would comment on Schultz’s assertion.)\n\nThere was, however, Putin to please. I asked Schultz if he’d ever had editorial disagreements with RT. “No. Not once,” he replied. Crimea? Syria? “No. Not in our shop.”\n\nI found that hard to believe. But his underlying critique is foundational to RT: the notion that CNN and Fox News, by virtue of their corporate owners and sponsors, reflect a U.S. perspective no less than state-funded RT reflects a Russian one. “There is not a single international foreign TV channel that is doing something other than promotion of the values of the country that it is broadcasting from,” Editor-in-Chief Simonyan told a Russian newspaper in 2016.\n\nTo that end, RT America’s 60-odd journalists are encouraged to see themselves as members of the alternative press. In morning editorial meetings, says one reporter, the easiest way to get a story greenlighted by Solodovnikov is to devise an angle that puts it in conflict with the “mainstream media.” That might mean framing reports on Russian hacking as neoliberal scaremongering, or staking out a story cable news was slow to cover, such as the Dakota Access Pipeline protest. A former producer says that when she was hired, she received a list of websites from which to gain inspiration. The main theme was skepticism of U.S. power, with liberal standard-bearers such as the Nation juxtaposed alongside tinfoil-hat concern InfoWars.\n\n“That’s their main point. To show that American society is descending into chaos”\n\nThe channel also self-selects for those suspicious of the mainstream press. Tyrel Ventura, co-host of the evening show Watching the Hawks and son of Jesse, says his dad was ostracized from politics, then cable news, for his heterodox beliefs. “I saw [MSNBC] essentially silence my father because he wouldn’t cheerlead the Iraq War,” says Ventura, 39. “Growing up, I already had that kind of skepticism of the quote-unquote official story of the media, learning about the JFK assassination and reading the People’s History of the United States.” He says he’s never been given marching orders at RT to cover anything—instead, the impetus is to find stories that aren’t “covered to death.”\n\nVentura isn’t spinning me. None of the dozen or so former and current employees I spoke with said they’d been coerced into airing positive content about Russia or its allies. Instead they described a blanket self-censorship: Clearly, certain stories—say, a negative piece about Assad, a Putin client—aren’t worth pitching. But in a more general sense, by casting all mainstream media reportage as corrupted—as fake news, in essence—RT claims the moral high ground for its own set of facts.\n\nThis dynamic is perhaps most evident in the work of RT’s Middle East correspondent, a 31-year-old Brit named Lizzie Phelan. Unlike her colleagues in the Western media, Phelan has been granted a journalist visa by Syria. As a result, she is confined to reporting from government-held areas unlikely to reflect the most heinous crimes of the Syrian regime. But what some might see as pro-Assad propaganda winds up looking, to a certain kind of skeptic, like credible indie journalism. Phelan’s work is popular on both the anti-imperialist Left and the alt-right.\n\nStaffwide self-censorship is useful in another regard: RT America probably couldn’t script propaganda if it wanted to. It isn’t organized enough. The news director, Solodovnikov—everyone calls him Misha—is a former Washington bureau chief for the Russian broadcaster VGTRK. Everyone I spoke to described him as apolitical. Instead, says Abby Martin, “he’s obsessed with aesthetics, lighting, the colors, the names.” Beyond that, there’s little quality control—Solodovnikov’s whims govern all. During the 2016 Rio Olympics, according to several staffers, he urged reporters to cover golf and tennis results—two events nobody cared about, but which he followed assiduously. One reporter recalls a meeting a couple of years earlier during which Misha enthusiastically suggested hiring a “midget” to appear on air. Often, current and former employees say, he wouldn’t show up to the office at all. Through a spokesperson, RT didn’t respond to the assertion about Solodovnikov’s hiring suggestion and described his comings and goings as “mundane.”\n\n“Do not call him an evil genius who is maniacally pulling the strings and making things happen,” Martin says. “It’s the contrary of that. There are weeks when he’s just gone. I have friends at RT now who are just like, ‘Misha hasn’t been here all month, we have no idea where he is.’ ”\n\nAt the outset of Trump’s presidency, as the web of known connections between his campaign and Russia grew stickier, RT America tended to cast itself as a victim of mainstream media bullying. In January, Chris Hedges, a former New York Times foreign correspondent who hosts the weekend show On Contact, said the Russian interference story was being pushed by a “compliant corporate media that operates in a nonfact-based universe every bit as pernicious as that inhabited by Trump.” A few days later, RT host Anya Parimpil mocked CNN on Twitter for covering a fireworks display at Trump’s inauguration rather than something more substantial. Anchor Jake Tapper tweeted: “Next time tune in when we’re discussing how your boss Vladimir Putin is responsible for human rights abuses and cyberattacks of US.” Parimpil shot back, “Childish McCarthyism aside, your *actual* boss, Jeff Zucker, created Trump. Now let’s watch careerists like you fall in line and punch left.”\n\nIn general, RT America seemed unsure how to cover the new administration. It was hard-wired to view American power skeptically, but disinclined to go negative on the putatively isolationist, pro-Vlad Trump. Like Jon Stewart after Barack Obama’s election, it seemed to have lost its raison d’être. It was the dog that caught the car. Would RT America, like Stewart, cast itself primarily as a critic of the president’s critics, or could it offer something more substantial?\n\nTo try and get an answer, I sat down in March with the enigmatic Misha at a cafe near RT America’s New York offices, on Manhattan’s East Side. Our interview was much delayed; RT America’s offices were under renovation, and he apparently didn’t want me to see the place in disarray.\n\nSolodovnikov, ginger-haired and bearded, was wearing red jeans and a blue blazer. That day, RT America had scored its first-ever daytime Emmy nomination, for On Contact. We began discussing RT’s ambitions for his shop. His goal, he said, was to “make RT America the No. 1 international network in the U.S.” I asked how he planned to do that. “You gotta have a good team, good journalists,” he said, in accented English. “You gotta have critical thinking.”\n\nHe didn’t articulate the editorial vision his ideal team of journalists would present, and instead supplied critiques of his competitors. BBC and France 24 were irrelevant, he said, and CNN’s talking-head approach was stale. “You watch certain networks and they almost behave like opposition parties, especially after elections,” he continued. “And I feel like as a viewer you get a feeling that all your taste buds are messed up, because you don’t get a taste for what’s really news anymore.”\n\nIt was hard to argue the point. And if the proliferation of biased and fraudulent journalism had poisoned the public’s appreciation for objective reporting, well, RT was happy to take advantage. “It’s never been easier for us to work in the United States,” Solodovnikov said. “It’s extremely easy to say the truth.”\n\nBut what would that truth look like? A few weeks later, in early April, Assad was accused of launching a chemical attack on his own citizens; two days after that the U.S. responded with a missile attack on a Syrian air base, reportedly giving Russia only a cursory heads-up. Putin called the gas attack a “false flag,” engineered to goad Trump into action.\n\nRT followed suit. The day after Putin’s statement, RT America reporter Alexey Yaroshevsky published an “exclusive” interview with an MIT professor who said he didn’t believe Assad was responsible for the chemical attack. The Moscow-based show Crosstalk, a Crossfire imitator, ran an episode called “War-a-Lago.” And a recent edition of liberal pundit Thom Hartmann’s The Big Picture was teased online with the headline “Trump Risks World War for Tiny Syrian Intervention.”\n\nSuddenly, U.S.-Russia relations had returned to their familiar dismal state. For RT, that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. “They win either way with Trump,” says Bob Orttung, an international relations professor at George Washington University who studies Russian media. “Even if he’s not particularly pro-Russian, they can elide that fact and focus on all the chaos. That’s their main point. To show that American society is descending into chaos.”\n\nEven for the most marginal of government-funded, internet-savvy cable-TV channels, that may not be a difficult task.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-04T08:30:00.000Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-rt-media/img/02_social.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"v13uE1dc10+TdsryIqU4bQ==\n"}

But a war is coming to the staid supermarket, and that could mean more consolidation, bankruptcies, and falling prices.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nAn invasion is getting under way. Lidl, a German retailer known for low prices and efficient operations, is expected to start an aggressive U.S. expansion in the coming weeks that could open as many as 100 new stores across the East Coast by the summer of 2018. The company, which runs about 10,000 stores in Europe, has also set its sights on Texas, one of the most competitive grocery markets in the U.S. Analysts expect Lidl to expand to nearly $9 billion in sales by 2023.\n\nThe last thing U.S. grocers need is more cutthroat competition. As the ranks of U.S. grocery stores have swelled, food has become a way for struggling brick-and-mortar retailers such as dollar stores and pharmacies to compete for customers. Even though groceries have been somewhat insulated from online pressure, Amazon.com remains dedicated to cracking the code, finally, on fresh food.\n\n\"It's an intimidating time for a lot of these retailers,\" said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"We're poised to see a lot more change in the next couple of years.\" These are the five forces that are going shake up the landscape of American groceries.\n\nIt Looked As Though There Was Safety Selling Food\n\nThese are tough times for the U.S. retail industry, with stores closing at a record pace so far in 2017. It’s no secret why: Amazon is gobbling up more and more sales of clothing, electronics, and other items that once drew shoppers to department stores and malls. The grocery business has been a safe haven in recent years. Only about 1 percent of the roughly $1.5 trillion industry has moved online. That’s made supermarkets an attractive real estate tenant in an era when other shopping has moved from the mall to the living room couch. The reliability of food sales has also drawn more and more stores into the market for prepared food, snacks, and other traditional grocery items as a reliable driver of store traffic. After all, we have to eat and get more garbage bags.\n\n“It’s perceived as relatively impervious to the shift online,” James Cook, director of retail research at JLL, said of the grocery business. \"For most of America, food is not purchased online.”\n\nNow Groceries Are Everywhere\n\nMore food is sold in more places these days, with pharmacies and dollar stores looking to groceries to lure customers. Dollar General alone added more than 900 stores last year, ending 2016 with more than 13,000 locations. The chain, which generates roughly 75 percent of revenue from consumable items such as food, soap, and paper towels, is planning to open another 1,000 stores this year. CVS, which operates nearly 8,000 standalone locations, is betting on food to boost store traffic. Like other pharmacies, where shoppers would traditionally visit to pick up deodorant along with a prescription, the chain has boosted its food offerings to add more healthy snacks and grab-and-go options.\n\nGrocery Prices Are Falling Fast\n\nAll this competition has come amid an historic bout of food deflation. Grocers have engaged in a price war that has been a boon for consumers while weighing down on corporate earnings—and those trends will only get more intense once Lidl opens its doors in the U.S. The company has long battled rival German grocer Aldi in markets across Europe. Both companies have taken on entrenched grocers and eaten into market share with their low prices and no-frills stores. Aldi, which has more than 1,600 U.S. stores, has spent the past couple years preparing for Lidl's arrival by aggressively expanding in Southern California and spending $1.6 billion to spruce up its locations. That has put pressure on Wal-Mart and the dollar stores in the competition for budget-conscious shoppers. Wal-Mart Stores, which generates more than half of its revenue from groceries, has been working to improve its fresh food offerings. The retail giant's low grocery prices have made things tough for Kroger Co., the largest supermarket chain in the U.S.\n\nLidl is slated to open 20 locations in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina this summer and could reach 630 locations over the next six years, according to Kantar Retail. The company had sales of roughly $69 billion last year. Expect Lidl's entrance into the U.S. to ramp up the price war and possibly force smaller, regional companies to close or consolidate. \"It's definitely making the regional players nervous,\" said Bartashus. \"It's like a stack of dominoes; it takes one thing to tip it, and they all start moving in one direction.\"\n\nLidl’s planned new locations. Source: Planned Grocery\n\nFood Shopping Isn't a Weekly Behavior Any More\n\nThe number of shopping trips Americans made to buy food rose rose 1 percent last year, according to Nielsen data. That may not sound like much, but it's the first annual gain in at least a decade. The shift in shopping behavior is being driven, in part, by the increasing preference for fresh food. Americans are shopping more often and buying fewer items per trip. The weekly trip to load up the station wagon is also being supplemented by everything from meal-kit services, such as Blue Apron, grocery deliveries, and visits to the local farmer’s market. The grocery business is known for its razor-thin margins and survival driven by repeat business. The fracturing of this pattern is a long-term risk for grocers, who have responded by boosting prepared food offerings.\n\nAmazon Is Hungry for Groceries\n\nSo far, at least, e-commerce has struggled to encroach on the grocery business. Amazon has tried for nearly a decade to find its way into delivering fresh food without much success. Now the online retail giant is opening brick-and-mortar stores, experimenting with drive-in grocery kiosks where consumers can pick up orders, and working on a hybrid supermarket that mixes the best of online and in-store shopping. Even though customers have been slow to adopt delivery for groceries, the business is expanding. There was a time when analysts felt consumers would never buy shoes online because they wanted to try them on. That sentiment is still applied to grocers—most people, the thinking goes, still want to touch the avocados or talk to a butcher. The looming threat of Amazon's encroachment is another potential headwind for the grocery business.","author":"Craig Giammona","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-04T09:00:23.750Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i39BxA_2w0EY/v0/1200x800.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"/Fpg5Or5p4ARf9SSOrw9Nw==\n"}

Then, those fears turned into something far worse.","title":"'This gets to the fabric of the nation': Inside the dark conspiracy that made its way from the fringe to the White House","url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-deep-state-bannon-cia-fbi-breitbart-fox-news-2017-5","text":"The modern history of the \"deep state\" in American politics — real or imagined — starts with real leaks of classified information and ends as a conspiracy theory on popular yet dubious websites.\n\nAnd how it got there raises serious questions about whether the intelligence community is trying to subvert a new president or whether it's a convenient scapegoat for an administration that's had its share of early foibles.\n\nA deep state is a network of influential members of a government’s agencies or military who operate against a democratically elected government. It might work to undermine an elected president’s authority or legitimacy and has been common in countries such as Egypt and Turkey.\n\nThe concern in the US started shortly after Donald Trump took office. In early February, The New York Times and The Washington Post published a series of explosive reports about the intelligence community’s investigations into the Trump campaign’s communications with Russian officials during the 2016 election.\n\nThe reports, citing anonymous officials, revealed that then national-security adviser Michael Flynn had discussed US sanctions on Russia with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump took office, despite Flynn’s claims that he and Kislyak had not discussed anything sensitive during their phone calls.\n\nThe next day, The Times broke a story on what it said were \"repeated contacts\" that Trump associates had with Russian officials during the campaign. CNN published another report that night in which sources said communication between Trump associates and Russian officials during the campaign was “constant.”\n\nFlynn resigned a short time later.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions later had to recuse himself from any Department of Justice investigations into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia after additional leaks revealed that he had also had contact with Russian officials during the campaign.\n\nAn American deep state?\n\nThe steady drip of classified leaks about President Trump’s young administration has led some to speculate about the beginnings of an American deep state.\n\nThe term is derived from the Turkish \"derin devlet,\" which refers to an intricate network made up of government officials, often including those from the military and intelligence communities, whose primary goal is to subvert a democratically elected leader's agenda and ultimately remove that leader from power.\n\nTurkey’s deep state is tethered to the army but consists of elements from the intelligence community, the judiciary, and the mafia. Turkish leaders, like current President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have waged political campaigns aimed at inciting public anger against the deep state.\n\nIn Egypt, less than a year after former Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi was elected into office by the people, Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, backed by Egypt's military might, detained Morsi and toppled his government. El-Sisi is now Egypt's head of state. El-Sisi’s ascent to power is thought by many to have been the result of an Egyptian deep state’s response to the 2011 Arab Spring.\n\nBut experts and former government officials have warned against using the term deep state to refer to rifts between the US president and the intelligence community.\n\nThe deep state, as it exists in Turkey and Egypt, has two defining characteristics, Aykan Erdemir, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Business Insider. First, it involves cooperation across multiple government agencies, like intelligence officials, military officials, and often executive branch officials. Second, the execution of the deep state’s agenda often results in bloody outcomes.\n\n\"You see dramatic results like assassinations, mass killings, pogroms, bombings — it’s not about tension between the executive and the bureaucracy, it’s not about a failure to work together,\" Erdemir said, adding that he would recommend \"extreme caution\" in adapting the term \"deep state\" from other political cultures and applying it to the US.\n\n\"'Deep state' I would never use,\" Michael Hayden, the former CIA director who served under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, told MSNBC in March. \"That’s a phrase we’ve used for Turkey and other countries like that, but not the American republic.\"\n\nFrom the fringe to Washington\n\nBut soon after the possibility of the beginnings of an American deep state was first raised by the mainstream media, the idea took hold of the far-right media, quickly reaching a fever pitch.\n\n\"The Deep State Bumps off General Flynn. Who's Next?\" blared a February Breitbart headline after the resignation of Flynn. The article pointed to the mainstream media as an arm of the deep state, saying that the \"ultimate target, of course, is Trump himself.\"\n\nInfoWars editor at large Paul Joseph Watson recorded a segment posted to YouTube in early March titled \"The Deep State War on Trump.\"\n\n\"Purge your administration of this globalist fifth column. There can be no compromise. These people literally want to overthrow a democratically elected government,\" Watson said.\n\nFrom the fringe, the idea of a deep state working against the Trump administration made its way to the mainstream conservative media.\n\nFox News host and ardent Trump supporter Sean Hannity reiterated Watson's words during a segment that aired a week after Watson's video was posted on YouTube. \"Tonight, it's time for the Trump administration to purge these saboteurs before it's too late,\" Hannity said, referring to \"deep-state Obama-holdover government bureaucrats who are hell bent on destroying this president.\"\n\nAnd from there, the fears of an American deep state powered by intelligence leaks, which started out as mild speculation and reached the heights of conspiracy theory, made their way to the halls of Washington.\n\nTrump has repeatedly and emphatically expressed his belief that there has been a concerted effort, fueled by politicians, those within the intelligence community, and the \"fake news\" media, to undermine his presidency and policy agenda.\n\nHe notably accused the former president, without evidence, of personally ordering the surveillance of phones at Trump Tower. Trump likely made the accusation based on a monologue by far-right radio talk-show host Mark Levin and a Breitbart write-up of Levin's belief that there is a \"silent coup\" underway to overthrow Trump.\n\nTrump’s cold war with the intelligence community\n\nThe president has also publicly castigated the media and the intelligence community.\n\n\"Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!\" Trump tweeted in February, shortly after Flynn resigned. \"The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught!\" he said.\n\nIn a meeting later with several members of Congress, he added: \"We're going to find the leakers, and they're going to pay a big price.\"\n\nAs the media continued publishing classified information, Trump tweeted that \"information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes \u0026 @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?). Just like Russia.\"\n\n\"The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy,\" he continued. \"Very un-American!\"\n\nTrump’s loyalists quickly followed his lead, pointing to the intelligence leaks as a key piece of evidence they say supports the existence of an American deep state. They’ve also consistently singled out Trump’s chief White House strategist, Steve Bannon, as a source of knowledge on the American deep state.\n\nBannon is the former head of Breitbart, a largely Trump-friendly outlet that has published a slew of articles asserting the existence of an American deep state.\n\n\"We are talking about the emergence of a deep state led by Barack Obama, and that is something that we should prevent,\" Iowa Rep. Steve King told The New York Times. \"The person who understands this best is Steve Bannon, and I would think that he's advocating to make some moves to fix it.\"\n\nEchoing Hannity’s and Watson’s words, King later said that Trump \"needs to purge the leftists within the administration that are holdovers from the Obama administration, because it appears that they are undermining his administration and his chances of success.\"\n\nTrump adviser and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich also believes in the deep state and said he discussed the concept with Bannon. \"Of course, the deep state exists. There's a permanent state of massive bureaucracies that do whatever they want and set up deliberate leaks to attack the president,\" Gingrich told the Associated Press in March.\n\n\"This is what the deep state does: They create a lie, spread a lie, fail to check the lie and then deny that they were behind the lie,\" Gingrich said.\n\nHe added that he and Bannon had discussed the idea and that Bannon compared its perils to the plot of the new season of \"Homeland,\" which includes a storyline in which career intelligence officials try to undermine the president-elect.\n\nThough Bannon has never used the term \"deep state\" publicly, he has repeatedly expressed distrust toward American institutions and the intelligence community.\n\nAfter he was removed from his post on the National Security Council in April, Bannon said that he was put on the council to \"ensure that it was de-operationalized,\" and added that the NSC has now returned \"to its proper function.\"\n\n'There have always been scandals … this is not new'\n\nDespite the theories and headlines, the leaking of classified information is not all that unusual and not enough to prompt suspicions of a legitimate deep state in the US, according to former intelligence officials.\n\nIntelligence leaks \"happened during the Clinton administration, the Bush administration, and long before that,\" Bob Deitz, a former NSA and CIA veteran who worked under presidents Clinton and Bush, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's possible that they came from directly within the White House, perhaps from people from the intelligence community on loan to the White House,\" he added. While the classified leaks that have been published in the media have reflected poorly on the administration, \"there are a lot of leaks from people in the White House that reflect badly on them. Just look at all the reports of infighting between Bannon and Kushner,\" Deitz said.\n\n\"There have always been scandals,\" Glenn Carle, a former CIA clandestine services officer and an expert on national security, told Business Insider. \"The torture black sites were leaked, the Pentagon Papers were leaked, the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident was leaked. This is not new.\"\n\nBoth Carle and Deitz added that more often than not, leaks of classified information come from the Hill. \"It is rare for them to come from the rank-and-file of the CIA\" or other intelligence agencies, Carle said.\n\n'If you serve the state, you betray it. If you betray the state, you betray it'\n\nThe dangers of a president and his allies believing in the existence of a covert effort to undermine him are profound, experts say, and it has placed those in the intelligence community in a tough position.\n\n\"The president has cast doubt on proven truths, undermined the laws, undermined the judiciary, the free press, the intelligence community,\" Carle said. \"He's undermined the very values upon which this society was built. So, what do you do if you're an intelligence official? If you serve the state, you betray it. If you betray the state, you betray it,\" he continued.\n\nThis dilemma, Carle said, has been widely discussed among those in the intelligence community, who have been forced to assess which is the greater threat: Trump’s \"authoritarian tendencies\" which threaten \"the fabric of the nation,\" or the clear national-security risks posed by a sustained stream of classified information being made public.\n\nIn this particular situation, in which the president of the US's campaign surrogates are under an active counterintelligence investigation for their suspected ties to a foreign power, \"when leaks come from the intelligence community, it's not to undermine the president or to protect the deep state. It's to protect democracy — it stems from a sense of profound patriotism,\" Carle said.\n\nWhatever the cause, classified information being leaked on a prolonged basis is treacherous, because it can send a message to the broader US intelligence community and government officials that leaking information is permissible.\n\n\"Everybody knows the White House has leaked information in pursuit of various foreign policy objectives throughout American history. When people see that, they might think, 'So, leaks are OK when the White House does it, but not OK if they come from somewhere other than the White House,'\" Deitz said. \"You lose the moral high ground.\"\n\nA 'gold mine' for foreign intelligence\n\nThere are a number of national-security risks that can result from tension between a president who believes he’s being undermined and the government officials or agencies who find themselves the target of that president’s ire.\n\n\"By definition, information is classified because its release could jeopardize national security,\" Deitz said, adding that while there are instances of over-classification, \"people cannot decide for themselves what information is OK to leak and what isn't. It doesn't work that way.\"\n\nIf the administration continues to publicly attack the intelligence community based on the belief that the national security apparatus is working against it, that could also open doors to hostile foreign powers looking to infiltrate American society.\n\n\"I spent my career exploiting the positions into which foreign officials were placed when they wanted the best for their society and wanted to uphold the oaths they made to their laws, and yet, the actions of their government undermined the very oaths they took,\" said Carle.\n\nNow, he said, American intelligence officials may well be in the same position.\n\n\"This is a gold mine of opportunity for foreign intelligence services,\" he said.\n\nThere are other national-security risks posed by the actions of a president who believes in the existence of a shadow government. In some cases, it has placed intelligence officials in the position of having to determine whether they can share information with their commander-in-chief.\n\nIn February, for instance, The Wall Street Journal reported that US intelligence officials had withheld some sensitive information from the president. Though information has been withheld from presidents and congressional members in the past, officials told The Journal none of those past decisions were affected by concerns about a president’s trustworthiness or discretion. This decision to withhold information from Trump highlighted the \"deep mistrust\" between Trump and the intelligence community.\n\nAnd if the rift between a White House that believes it’s being undermined by the institutions designed to serve American interests and those institutions themselves continues to widen, the risks to national security could be almost as severe as those posed by a legitimate deep state.\n\n\"The deep state does not exist in fact but it exists in the minds of Trump supporters. That’s just as much a threat to society,\" Carle said.","author":"Sonam Sheth","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T20:43:00.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5898def06e09a880028b4849-1190-625/this-gets-to-the-fabric-of-the-nation-inside-the-dark-conspiracy-that-made-its-way-from-the-fringe-to-the-white-house.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"6pSN1G5EKx6LBm9pND8uyQ==\n"}

Here's what happened when a steel mill worker in Ohio found himself having dinner with Mark Zuckerberg.","title":"What it's like to have a surprise dinner with Mark Zuckerberg","url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-have-a-surprise-dinner-with-mark-zuckerberg-2017-5","text":"About two weeks ago, Daniel Moore received a cryptic phone call.\n\nThe 57-year-old resident of Newton Falls, Ohio was told that a billionaire philanthropist from California wanted to meet and have dinner with his family.\n\n“I thought it was a prank phone call,\" Moore told Business Insider during a recent interview. \"I almost hung up.”\n\nMoore pressed the person on the other end of the phone to reveal his employer's identity. While the staffer refused to give a name, he teased that 90% of Americans use his boss's product every day. Moore agreed to the visit.\n\nA few days later, another staffer showed up at Moore's house for a \"preliminary visit.\" He walked around Moore's property, took pictures, and asked to come inside and help decide where his boss would have dinner with Moore's family.\n\nAfter a few more days of planning that involved the billionaire's staff arranging the dinner menu and catering from a local restaurant, another employee arrived at Moore's house on the evening of the planned visit. Moore was informed that the identity of his mystery dinner guest would be revealed just 15 minutes before he arrived.\n\nAnd like clockwork, 15 minutes after Moore was finally told the name of his guest, a convoy of black SUVs drove through Moore's quiet neighborhood, pulled into his driveway, and parked in his front yard.\n\nOut stepped Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nWhen Zuck comes to town\n\nFacebook's 32-year-old CEO has given himself a personal goal of visiting the roughly 30 U.S. states he hasn't been to yet by the end of 2017. The reason why? To \"get out and talk to more people about how they're living, working and thinking about the future,\" he wrote in a Facebook post from January.\n\nMoore, who works in a Russian-owned steel mill as an engineer, described Zuckerberg as a “real down to earth, outgoing guy” with “good manners\" who asked to take his shoes off before he entered the house.\n\nThe guest list included Moore's wife and kids, as well as a few local friends.\n\nMoore wanted to seat the Facebook CEO at the head of the table, but a staffer told him that Zuckerberg preferred otherwise. \"He does not feel comfortable at the head. He likes to be surrounded by people,” Moore recalls being told. So instead Zuckerberg sat at the middle of the dining room table, with his staff in the kitchen, pecking away at their laptops during the meal.\n\nAs everyone ate dinner over plastic plates, Moore asked Zuckerberg to explain what brought him to northeast Ohio.\n\nZuckerberg said he was on a “fact-finding mission,\" according to Moore, and that last year it \"dawned on me that I don’t know my own country.\"\n\nThe elephant in the room quickly became President Trump. Moore is a self-described political activist and independent who voted for Obama twice before voting for Trump. His wife Lisa is a school teacher who also voted for Trump on his promise to abolish Common Core.\n\nAfter Zuckerberg asked them why they had voted for Trump, Moore turned the tables and asked if Zuckerberg had spoken with Trump since he was elected. Zuckerberg, who was noticeably absent from Trump's meeting with tech leaders in December, said he had in fact talked with Trump multiple times on the phone.\n\nPresidential speculation\n\nZuckerberg's statesman-like, cross-country tour immediately sparked more speculation that he was preparing to run for president, a rumor that's refused to die over the past year.\n\nZuckerberg has helped fuel the speculation by regularly posting photos on his Facebook page that look like they're from a campaign trail. He's been photographed working the assembly line at a Michigan Ford factory, hanging out with firefighters, and even feeding a calf on a farm in rural Ohio.\n\nBut if there's one message Zuckerberg and his dozens of staffers want to get across, it's that this U.S. tour is not an elaborate publicity stunt designed to set the stage for his eventual run for office. After his surprise dinner with Zuckerberg last week, Daniel Moore said he was instructed by the CEO's spokeswoman to \"hammer home\" to anyone who asked that Zuckerberg had no aspirations to make a presidential bid.\n\nEven still, Zuckerberg has surrounded himself with numerous former government officials who accompany him on his trips.\n\nAmy Dudley, the chief spokeswoman for his philanthropic fund The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, was previously the communications director for Hillary Clinton's running mate and Virginia senator Tim Kaine. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's director of travel operations, James Eby, previously served in the same role for the Department of Defense.\n\nThe list even extends to Zuckerberg's personal photographer, Charles Ommanney, who worked for the White House during both Obama terms. The eight bodyguards and roughly half-dozen aides who accompanied Zuckerberg to Moore's house for dinner were all identified as former Secret Service members, Moore told Business Insider.\n\nZuckerberg himself has publicly said that he has no plans to run for president. He shared the same sentiment in private to Moore and his family over dinner last week.\n\n“I have absolutely no interest in running for president of the United States.,\" Moore recalled Zuckerberg saying. \"I’m very happy running my own company. I believe I can make a huger impact through my company and through the initiatives I’m rolling out.\"\n\nScouting for ideas\n\nClad in his trademark gray T-shirt, Zuckerberg discussed his remarkable journey from the Harvard dorm room where he created Facebook thirteen years ago.\n\n“Never in my wildest dreams did I think Facebook would be where it is today, I never expected to make this amount of money,\" Moore says Zuckerberg told him.\n\nZuckerberg has committed to giving away 99% of his roughly $60 billion net worth through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which he runs with his wife Priscilla Chan. He's so far invested in education startups and pledged $3 billion to aide curing the world's diseases.\n\n“Just think, if I was in Washington D.C., how much could I do?\" Moore remembered Zuckerberg saying over dinner. \"How much progress could I make there?”\n\nA Chan Zuckerberg spokesperson said that while some of Zuckerberg's trips are organized by Facebook, many are organized through his fund as a way to see potential areas of investment.\n\n\"The chance to meet people in communities across the country informs work being done by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to advance human potential and promote equality in communities across the country,\" the spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nZuckerberg's visit to Ohio last week included a community college's machine learning lab, an opioid addiction clinic, and a juvenile detention center, according to the spokesperson. Each of the stops could be seen as hints towards areas of future investments. The spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of what Zuckerberg said at Moore's house or why they were selected for a visit.\n\nWhile Moore admitted to knowing little about Zuckerberg before the visit, he says he is a frequent user of Facebook. And he's now one of the CEO's 90 million followers on the social network.\n\n“There’s a lot more to Mark Zuckerberg than just Facebook,\" he said.","author":"Alex Heath","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T12:30:00.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/590d428f69e69a1e008b4f44-1190-625/what-its-like-to-have-a-surprise-dinner-with-mark-zuckerberg.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"3p5LVa4chRSVcjYT06iM7Q==\n"}

The previous record was $29.6 million, which went towards a 2012 House race in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nGeorgia's special election captured national attention when former congressional aide and rising Democratic star Jon Ossoff became a serious contender for the seat, which had been held by a Republican for the last 40 years.\n\nThe first round of the election ended in a runoff, with Ossoff failing to break the 50% threshold required to win an outright victory. He received 48% of the vote in a field crowded with Republicans, while his closest challenger, Republican Karen Handel, garnered 20%.\n\nThe race for the 6th district is seen by many as the first major referendum on Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 election, and polls show an increasingly tight contest between Ossoff and Handel, who is Georgia's former secretary of state.\n\nOne poll released on Friday showed Ossoff with a narrow 50% to 48% lead over Handel.\n\nSome political strategists feel the fundraising dollar amount could go even higher ahead of the June 20 runoff, which is still six weeks away. \"It’s entirely possible that by the time the books are closed on this race, there will be over $40 million spent in the special and in the runoff,\" Chip Lake, a Republican strategist who works in Georgia, told Politico. \"I'm at a loss for words.\"\n\n\"Jon Ossoff is being bankrolled by Nancy Pelosi and liberal Hollywood actors whose progressive agenda matches his own,\" Jesse Hunt, the press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee, told Business Insider when asked about the party's fundraising effort towards the election. \"It's a competitive race with national attention so we're happy to play a role in pointing out how out-of-step Ossoff is with Georgia's 6th District.\"\n\nIn addition to big-dollar investments coming in from the Democratic and Republican congressional campaign committees, the race has also attracted a high level of grassroots excitement, Democratic strategist Taryn Rosenkranz told Politico.\n\nRachel Paule, a grassroots organizer in Georgia, told Business Insider that the biggest indicator she had seen of local Democratic sentiment was the number of \"secret liberals who have come out of the woodwork\" since President Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 election.\n\nA Republican congressman \"was just sort of a given, and a lot of people were afraid to speak out because this is such a conservative area,\" Paule said of Georgia's 6th District.\n\nOssoff's candidacy spurred Paule and her fellow organizers into action, in large part because many saw Ossoff as their \"first chance\" to \"make a meaningful change by flipping the seat,\" Paul said, adding that the most recent Democratic candidate in the district didn't campaign, have a website, take donations, or make appearances.\n\nOther grassroots organizers have cited Trump's victory as a driving force behind their efforts to propel Ossoff to victory.\n\n\"After Trump won the election, our group doubled in numbers,\" Shari Sprigle, one of the founders of the grassroots group Liberal Moms of Roswell and Cobb, told Business Insider. \"During the time of the election, we were at 600 members. Now we're at 1800,\" she added. The group has been active in Georgia's 6th district since 2015, but Sprigle said the \"level of offensiveness of Trump\" fueled the group's effort to flip the seat in favor of a Democrat.\n\nRepublicans have also ratcheted up the amount of attention and resources they're dedicating to the race. Handel's campaign raised more than $1 million the week after the primary, the report said, and she drew in an addition \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars when Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan spearheaded separate fundraisers in her support.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a conservative super PAC, announced that it would pour $8.5 million into the race by the June 20 runoff, which is a record for any outside group in a House election.\n\nDespite both sides putting an unprecedented amount of money into this election, Republicans are aware of the future risks posed by a spike in Democratic grassroots action.\n\n\"If Democrats are able to raise small dollars from donors in a big way like they’ve done so far, then this is probably going to be the most expensive midterm we’ve seen thus far,\" one Republican national strategist told Politico. \"It’s the clearest signal yet for every single Republican member of the House running for reelection that if you are not raising money and if you are not running a professional campaign, you are vulnerable to defeat.\"","author":"Sonam Sheth","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T17:59:00.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/58f6f781f40dae1c008b56d9-1190-625/a-special-house-race-in-georgia-is-officially-the-most-expensive-in-us-history.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"YLYsB14adZBBMB1fIhA0mA==\n"}

This is my passion! This is what I want to do!'\" Lachs told Business Insider. \"That absolutely didn’t happen.\"\n\nThat moment of clarity didn't happen in that instant, but it would several years later when Lachs realized the spreadsheets she'd been using as a general manager of a food-delivery startup were just the tip of the data that the startup could be using to fine-tune its business.\n\nTo dig deeper, Lachs taught herself how to code and learning just one programming language to start set her on the path to running one of the most important departments at DoorDash, a $700 million food delivery startup that's challenging the likes of GrubHub and UberEats.\n\nTaking a gamble\n\nLachs tends to be risk-averse, so giving up her Wall Street career on the gamble that she'd find something she'd love in business school was \"really scary,\" she says now looking back. Lachs enrolled at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and took a variety of classes trying to find her niche in the business world.\n\n“It’s really easy to tell the story and say 'Oh, I went to business school to figure out what I wanted to do.' But to actually live through that and not know what I wanted to do and not know where I was going to be was a pretty scary thing,\" Lachs said.\n\nA basic computer science class never held her attention, but a class in entrepreneurship started to change her perspective on what it meant to be in business.\n\n\"The class made me realize entrepreneurs don’t always look like what, in my mind, they look like,\" Lachs said. \"In my mind, they’re these incredibly charismatic, white male, visionary — basically the opposite of me.\"\n\nAs part of her class, she started a business called Gift Simple where multiple friends or family could contribute to an expensive gift like an iPad or expensive TV. She stuck with the business after graduation, but before long she had to don her banker hat again and took a hard look at her business' numbers.\n\n\"While it was a nice small business, it was never going to be a DoorDash,\" Lachs said. \"That’s when I decided to do something else.\"\n\nJoining the startup world\n\nIt was another risk, but this time Lachs worked her way to finding her true passion: data.\n\nThrough the New York startup scene, she got an introduction to Sequoia Capital, a venture firm that introduced her to Tony Xu. The former Stanford grad had launched a food delivery startup in Palo Alto and needed a general manager to help launch in new cities.\n\nJoining a tech startup as a woman didn't give Lachs pause, despite the industry's notoriety towards treatment of women. Even the most valuable private tech startup, Uber, is currently undergoing an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n\"To be honest, the thought didn’t really cross my mind when joining tech. It was just that it was going to be a lot like banking,\" Lachs said. \"The fact that I’m a woman here is sort of a non-issue.\"\n\nShe joined DoorDash in June 2014 when the startup only had 20 to 30 people and helped build it from there. At first, it was a do-everything-that-was-necessary gig, whether it was going out to sell new restaurants or orienting new drivers (called Dashers) to the system — \"even taking out the garbage every Saturday night,\" Lachs said.\n\nBut the more DoorDash launched new markets, more questions would come up. Boston didn't work the same as Palo Alto, and Los Angeles was on a different growth trajectory than San Jose. There were a lot of questions that the company wanted answered, but no one in place to be that go-to person.\n\n\"Maybe I’m a know-it-all, but I love having the answers to things. And in order to get these answers, you really have to dig into the data,\" Lachs said. \"That became my role, to be the sort of Q\u0026A center for DoorDash.\"\n\nTwo weeks of the basics\n\nLachs' background in banking meant she could do the job well enough by just working on her Excel spreadsheets. But that quickly became a limitation. DoorDash had tons of data it was collecting on its business, from how much couriers were making on each order to which items were the most popular on weekends, but it was up to Lachs to start processing it.\n\nDetermined to learn how to code, she spent two weeks learning the basics of SQL, a basic programming language for working in databases to pull and extract information. Lachs largely learned through all of the free online classes available and leaned on her co-workers that had experience to help her through the tricky spots.\n\n\"A two-week investment and you can be a beginner and pull some basic data,\" Lachs said. \"I think where people get stuck is that basic SQL doesn’t get you very far in the real world because data sets are never as neat and clean as the ones that are in the tutorial. And making that jump is much trickier.\"\n\nIt took Lachs another month or two to learn enough that she could solve about 80% of the questions asked of her. One of the first challenges they tackled was learning how much a Dasher needs to make in different markets in order to keep them working for DoorDash and not desert to another competitor.\n\nI'm a testament to the fact that you really can teach yourself a lot now.\n\nThese days, Lachs team has expanded from just her to now 8 people and she's now officially the Head of Business Operations and Analytics for the company. By the end of 2017, she hopes to have doubled the number of people on her team.\n\nIn addition to its works on the hard problems, like shaping a market, Lachs' team also works on fun stuff. The company's PR team loves to make crazy requests like what foods are spiking during the presidential debates in red vs blue states, or random trivia like how many menu items on DoorDash say \"Earth\" for Earth Day.\n\n“That contributes to morale more than the bottom line, but it just goes to show you how diverse a data role can be from some of the light-hearted stuff to something more serious,” Lachs said.\n\nJust because her team has found success in building the food delivery startup into the $700 million company it is today doesn't mean Lachs has stopped trying to learn. To this day, Lach keeps a bookmark folder on her computer called \"Learning\" with links to more courses and tutorials she wants to take. But now, she's one of the leaders at DoorDash who is teaching a new wave of employees how to analyze data beyond an Excel spreadsheet and become empowered as a result.\n\n“I’m a testament to the fact that you really can teach yourself a lot now,\" Lachs said. \"There are a ton of great resources out there if you want to learn something, between free online resources, the videos, and just the people that you surround yourself with — you can learn pretty much everything.”","author":"Biz Carson","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T12:00:00.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/590cee1f69e69ac9048b4d6c-1190-625/a-former-banker-taught-herself-how-to-code-and-is-now-a-top-exec-at-a-700-million-startup.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"Rd5atb1eaW4zaa0R2pDIPA==\n"}

Please take care fake your gender can be [penalised].'","title":"These Trans Women Were Asked To Show Their Passports To Enter A Female Gaming Tournament","url":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/trans-women-barred-from-gaming-tournament","text":"\"No males are allowed. Please take care fake your gender can be [penalised].\"\n\nA group of transgender women were barred from taking part in a female online gaming tournament after being told by an organiser they could be penalised for faking their gender.\n\nSly Buehl Rigilio, a transgender gamer who lives in Sicily, Italy, told BuzzFeed News via email that her recent gender transition has been tough as she is an \"avid gamer\".\n\n\"I have been gaming since I was around 10. Gaming has always helped me cope with the burden of not being able to express my true feelings fully,\" she said.\n\n\"As you've probably heard, we're not very welcomed in this community, at least among the average player. [But when] I met a group of other transgender girls, things started to look up from there.\"\n\nRigilio and her fellow gamers play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (a first-person shooter game) and were excited to enter an online female tournament starting on 30 April, hosted by the Electronic Sports League (ESL) and organised by the Munich Finest Gaming company in Germany. The tournament, called Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 5on5 Female Open Summer 2017, was established after requests from female gamers, aimed to foster talent among women in esports. But after Rigilio sent in her team's entry on 28 April, she received an email rejecting the request and stating: \"No males are allowed. Please take care fake your gender can be [penalised].\" [sic]\n\nRigilio alleges the team was rejected based of the photographs they supplied.\n\n\"Now when I saw this [email], I almost broke down in tears; here I am thinking we finally have a shot to shine and show our true colours to the gaming world... and then we get shut down based on our looks, because we didn't look 'female' enough for them,\" she said. Rigilio wrote to the Munich Finest Gaming support team, asking for an explanation about why they were banned and accusing the organisers of discrimination. An admin replied and said they could enter the team into the tournament manually – but only after each team member submitted a passport marked female. Two more attempts to enter the tournament by Rigilio were met with messages simply stating \"female only\". According to information provided by ESL and the Munich Finest Gaming company, every new sign-up is automatically rejected in order to prevent trolls and divert genuine competitors to identity checks. ESL's director of communications, Anna Rozwandowicz, told BuzzFeed News that Rigilio's team was not barred because they are transgender, but because they failed to produce female passports. \"The bottom line of this dispute is that the Female Open tournament is a German event, held in Germany, organized by a German company [Munich Finest Gaming], and as such the rulebooks have to comply with German common law,\" she said. \"And in Germany at this point, your official, legal gender is the one that's listed in your passport or any other government-issued ID. \"I completely understand the team's frustration at the situation, but I also understand that our admins have done their jobs by following the rules as it was required of them.\"\n\nBut Rigilio contends the team was singled out and \"judged based off of our looks\". \"The company clearly doesn't take initiative in explaining [the automatic rejection process], which leads me to believe they don't actually do that to everyone,\" she said. \"It's extremely upsetting and I wish we could be treated like normal people, because we are just that. Just when I thought gaming could be our outlet, we were wrong.\"\n\nShe added that the gaming company should have stated in the rules that transgender women are not allowed so her team wouldn't have \"wasted our time\".\n\nThe tournament rules state that every team with five female players has the right to play.\n\n\"Due to the specific restriction of this tournament, only female players are allowed to play,\" the rules say. \"If we are not sure about the gender of any player we will need an official documentation stating a players' gender is female.\"\n\nRigilio said it was “completely disgusting” and excluded transgender women to require the team to submit their passports. \"Gender isn't just as simple as what was written on your old passport, there's more to it,\" she said. \"Some of us have already started [hormone replacement therapy], and some others are fairly new to coming out and expressing themselves as a female. I know some of the girls in the group have yet to go through the trouble of getting their info changed on [their passports], so we are out of luck.\" Rozwandowicz said there had been multiple incidents of male players trying to enter female tournaments as a joke.\n\n\"As female tournaments are meant to help develop and support the female eSports scene, we are extra careful to triple-check that those who want to participate in female tournaments, are also eligible to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"For the record, I am not saying that we think the team in question is trying to troll us – I am saying that the extra checks we performed on them, we performed on everyone else to ensure the competitive integrity of the tournament is safeguarded.\" In partnership with Intel, ESL founded the AnyKey organisation, which promotes diversity in esports. The AnyKey website states it is committed to a \"long term vision of a gaming community that is welcoming to all players, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disability, religious belief, background, or physical appearance.\"","author":"Lane Sainty","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T03:44:12.000Z"},"source":"buzzfeed","urlToImage":"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-05/5/6/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/these-trans-women-were-asked-to-show-their-passpo-2-16011-1493978452-11_dblbig.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"ui+EwbprL6ODdCOfHh/w6Q==\n"}

The only other drug specifically for the treatment of ALS is riluzole, which was approved for use in the United States in 1995.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved Radicava to treat patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\n\"After learning about the use of edaravone to treat ALS in Japan, we rapidly engaged with the drug developer about filing a marketing application in the United States,\" Eric Bastings, the deputy director of the FDA's neurology products division, said in a statement . \"This is the first new treatment approved by the FDA for ALS in many years, and we are pleased that people with ALS will now have an additional option.\"\n\nLou Gehrig's Disease\n\nALS is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease . It affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that make muscles work. Those nerve cells lose their ability to initiate and control muscle movement, which leads to paralysis and death.\n\nALS is also called Lou Gehrig's disease, named after the famous baseball player who retired in 1939 because of the condition.\n\nThe disease gained new prominence in 2014, thanks to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. Fueled by social media, the campaign prompted millions of people to post videos of themselves dumping cold water on their heads and drove $115 million dollars in donations to the ALS Association in just eight weeks. The flood of donations helped fund important developments in ALS research, the association said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Don Lemon accepts 'Ice Bucket Challenge' Replay More Videos ...

Its wearables business is virtually nonexistent, and for some odd reason (actually it's because CEO Brian Krzanich wanted to focus on smartphones and tablets), Intel sold its OnCue streaming video service to Verizon. With autonomous cars looming large on the horizon, the chip maker is once again striking out on a new venture. Yet unlike a watch that tracks your steps, whose need is questionable, cars aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Based on what I saw at an event this week, it seems like Intel actually has a chance to finally have a secondary business that thrives.\n\nThe company jump-started its autonomous road map with the acquisition of vision-based-driver-assistance company Mobileye, back in March. In buying Mobileye, Intel inherited the company's existing relationships with 25 automotive partners, making it a shrewd purchase. One of the biggest Mobileye partners is tier-one automotive supplier Delphi, and that collaboration has already yielded results.\n\nAt the launch of the Silicon Valley Innovation Center for Autonomous Driving, Intel, along with BMW and Delphi, showed off the first highly automated vehicles the companies will be testing. For Intel -- a company that's been serious about autonomous driving for only about nine months -- working with the German automaker is huge.\n\nBut it's not just partnerships that look promising. The chip manufacturer has also launched an AI division of its own, is poised to launch 5G vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, and is working on the \"big data\" problem of processing all that cross-platform sensor data. Intel even played to its technical advantage and put together an SDK so automakers and suppliers won't have to change their code when they switch from testing on a low-cost Atom to graduating to a high-power Xeon processor.\n\nWhile getting into the auto game is clearly an opportunity for Intel, it's easy to surmise that the end goal is to sell more silicon. As was already pointed out, the company makes cellular radios, so it has the chops to bring 5G communication to vehicles, and all those computers either on the server side or inside the cars will need something to crunch all that data. Really the only thing Intel needs to do is build up its AI technology. It won't be too difficult to start getting chips ready for the new autonomous vehicle division.\n\n\"It's taking things we already know but making them automotive-grade,\" said Kathy Winter, vice president of Intel's automated driving group. Winter came to Intel nine months ago. Previously she was Delphi's vice president of software and services for automated driving. So it looks like the company is making all the right moves.\n\nIntel may have been late to mobile and missed out on a huge business, but autonomous driving still has a ways to go before any of us will be chauffeured around town by our cars. If Intel can stick with it and pull this off, it won't feel left behind, and it may actually be able to boast that self-driving cars have Intel inside.","author":"Roberto Baldwin","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T20:00:00.000Z"},"source":"engadget","urlToImage":"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630\u0026quality=80\u0026image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F11edeae76b3a24d0cab9d6b26244bbf8%2F205238439%2F0505_intel-7.jpg\u0026client=cbc79c14efcebee57402\u0026signature=528aa1d84ee78ab5d987ea7b23900416618e09ce","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"658CdEVcXLGTIuYdK0x1XA==\n"}

And only (mostly white) men will shape the world. @WIRED Brilliant Hackers https://t.co/il1HVIDUUR — Cindy Gallop (@cindygallop) April 27, 2017\n\nYou see, every single one, down to a man, was ... a man.\n\nHack just as much, get 100% less press\n\nThis seemed odd to the infosec community. And the hackers and researchers, and actual makers and breakers, said so.\n\nWhy are you just reinforcing all the stereotypes of who world-changes are and aren't, @WIRED? Do better. https://t.co/ZYEP3vedmF — Laura Weidman Powers (@laurawp) April 28, 2017\n\nThis @WIRED story is so depressing https://t.co/qUuscHuidu no women *at all*...how is that even possible these days? — ʎɐʍollɐפ ʇʇoɔS (@scottgal) April 28, 2017\n\nBTW they were only able to find mostly wm 🙄 The Brilliant, Candy-Loving Hackers of Stetson West https://t.co/H1hMznKWVq via @WIRED — Christina M. (@divinetechygirl) April 28, 2017\n\nHearing the outcry, the magazine's editor took to the pages of his personal Facebook account -- not the magazine itself -- to make an apology. Editor in Chief Nicholas Thompson admitted that \"many readers have pointed out\" that \"none of the seven people is a woman. It's not the most racially diverse collective either.\"\n\nIf it had seemed to infosec that the magazine might've had to go out of its way to find such an un-diverse group of hackers ... turns out, it did. Thompson's social media post revealed that during the course of reporting the story, there was \"a meeting with the woman who runs the college's official hacking group.\"\n\nNow, we can all bag on Wired and be annoyed at the lack of female and black editors everywhere, or lament infosec's wider problems with attracting a diverse workforce. Because Wired definitely didn't learn anything after their boob-tastic cover disaster. And have you ever tried to pitch a piece on women or people of color in hacking? Even cybersecurity CEOs have been hitting infosec over the head about hiring a diverse workforce to keep them from being \"weak.\"\n\nBut Wired hit the zeitgeist in a way it didn't plan to. The article explained that \"ours is a culture fascinated, and terrified, by teenagers who know computers better than most of us will ever...\" What it actually described is that ours is a culture fascinated with erasing women from the hacking narrative altogether.\n\nIt's the same thing that happened when the Washington Post profiled hacker collective L0pht in 2011. The article featured at length the men -- and the guys who hung around them -- who could've saved us from our current security doom if only people had listened. And indeed: Members from the Boston collective testified to Congress about the dangers we currently face.\n\nYou can probably tell where this is going. There was a glaring omission in WaPo's glowing piece: The women of L0pht.\n\nYou would never have known from reading about the amazing male hacker club that it was also where famous contemporary female hackers were hacking too. Ones like Katie Moussouris, chief policy officer of the HackerOne bug bounty clearinghouse and founder of Luta Security. And open-source pioneer, engineer Limor Fried, CEO of Adafruit (photo).\n\nThere are more -- if anyone decides to look. I have. \"The women of L0pht\" is a story I've pitched many times. It is odd arguing the relevance of this kind of story to (usually nontechnical) male editors. Clearly no one is questioning pitches for articles about \"men who hack.\"\n\nI'm starting to think we need a Bechdel Test for this sort of thing.\n\nEven pronouns are more inclusive now\n\nIt's not even a new trend. Wired and WaPo are simply part of a tradition. The erasure of women in hacking has a historical precedent. In a stunning coincidence, the documentation comes from Northeastern's own Professor Meryl Alper.\n\nHer academic paper \"Can Our Kids Hack It With Computers? Constructing Youth Hackers in Family Computing Magazines (1983–1987)\" analyzes where our modern hacker narrative came from. Spoiler: It's all about fetishizing brilliant young men. She points out, \"We should further scrutinize though who is missing from these narratives: girls and youth of color.\"\n\nOf @wired's seven hackers who will change the world, all are men, all are Americans, and 5 are white https://t.co/63kdYxbXfS — Nate Hoffelder (@thDigitalReader) April 28, 2017\n\nFor nearly 40 years, in popular media, boys are never described as being nontechnical before they acquire the skill of hacking. Nor do \"stories about male hackers portray this transformation from novice to nerd.\" Alper notes that \"when female hackers are made visible, discussion is primarily limited to either their social exclusion or their initial lack of 'natural' technical skills.\"\n\nSo it's just the way things are done. It's also, you know, lazy.\n\nIt's really too bad that Wired's editor didn't actually change anything with his Facebook apology. Like all good apologizers, he said he was sorry that it happened, and that it wasn't the right thing to do. And he gets props for not ignoring the hackers who called him out. But what a missed opportunity! He could've told us why it wasn't the right thing to do. And no, not because we have to show diversity now or we're a magazine of influence so we should pretend to be socially responsible.\n\nIt was wrong because their \"here are the people who are the future of hacking\" article was inaccurate. That's not what the future of hacking looks like and we all know it. It's not even the present of hacking. That was an old fantasy of hacking's future, following a template set in motion by magazines from the 1980s, whose editors were men born in the 1940s and '50s.\n\nIt's actually not what the future of hacking ever looked like.\n\nPhotograph by Rayon Richards for Distro Magazine – Issue 75 (Limor Fried)","author":"Violet Blue","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T19:29:00.000Z"},"source":"engadget","urlToImage":"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630\u0026quality=80\u0026image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fb2ec0b3e4ee4e127e2dea11db047b4d9%2F205238312%2FErased-01-ed-2.jpg\u0026client=cbc79c14efcebee57402\u0026signature=fa34847b480e9181ae53da9ca982e5df3398a47f","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"CuLIcACZ/rBgN1Gz1eHGLA==\n"}

But James Gunn doesn’t care about all that so much. The writer-director behind Marvel’s space opera sequel penned an emotional letter to the fans, honoring their loyalty and getting to the core of what the Guardians mean to him.\n\n“I would be lying if I said I don’t get distracted by the numbers. The first thing I do in the morning is roll over in bed and check my phone for the morning box office reports. But, in the end, it’s not what matters to me,” Gunn wrote on Facebook Saturday.\n\nHe recalled, “When I was young I felt utterly alone, at times to the point of suicidal thoughts. I never felt like I belonged, had an incredibly difficult time connecting to other people and, despite having love around me, I had an impossible time experiencing it, or taking it in. But I found my respite in popular entertainment — Marvel comics, science fiction and horror films, the music of The Sex Pistols, The Replacements, and Queen.\n\n“Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined,” he continued. “Sometimes these works were simply escapist fantasies that distracted me from the difficulties of my internal life. But other times, in the strongest moments – maybe through the words of Alice Cooper or Freddie Mercury, through Cronenberg films, or even in Chewbacca’s growl, I experienced something deeper – the realization that I wasn’t completely alone. Someone out there was as weird and strange and whacked out as I was.”\n\nThe true meaning of Vol. 2‘s success, then, is that he can continue telling stories that allow him to connect with audiences.\n\n“I haven’t worked two and a half years just to watch a string of numbers getting higher,” he wrote. “I work because I like telling stories. I work because I love the relationships I have with my collaborators. And I do it because I like connecting with people, and the easiest way I know how to do that is through filmmaking. I do it so that some kid in Thailand, or England, or Colombia, or Brazil, or Japan, or Russia, or anywhere, can hear the frequency of his or her own heart bouncing back off the Guardians.”\n\nGunn concluded, “No matter how much world leaders are telling you we aren’t in this together, we are. You are not alone.”\n\nRead Gunn’s letter in full below.\n\nVol. 2, currently playing theaters, had already earned more than $160 million from international locations before opening in 4,300+ theaters in the U.S. The film is expected to reach the $150 million range at the domestic box office by Sunday night.","author":"Nick Romano","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T21:47:41.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i1.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-6704315501.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"pPQfwa/ovrapleLNCFRKtw==\n"}

A statement on Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign website claims “the mainstream TV networks have blocked the ad from running, including CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC.”\n\nThe TV spot, approved by Trump and celebrating his first 100 days in The White House, includes a graphic that promotes the idea media is “fake news.” Trump’s campaign statement called the act of blocking it “a chilling precedent against free speech rights.”\n\nLara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law and consultant on his 2020 reelection campaign, said, “Apparently, the mainstream media are champions of the First Amendment only when it serves their own political views. Faced with an ad that doesn’t fit their biased narrative, CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC have now all chosen to block our ad. This is an unprecedented act of censorship in America that should concern every freedom-loving citizen.”\n\nCNN was the first network to refuse to air the “First 100 Days” ad. “CNN requested that the advertiser remove the false graphic that says the mainstream media is ‘fake news,'” the network responded in a statement on Tuesday. “The mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false. Per our policy, it will be accepted only if the graphic is deleted. Those are the facts.”\n\nIn response to the Donald J. Trump for President campaign’s accusations of ad censorship: pic.twitter.com/0Rbanpf0dn — CNN Communications (@CNNPR) May 2, 2017\n\nAn ABC spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday, “We rejected the ad because it did not meet our guidelines. We have previously accepted Trump ads and are open to doing so in the future.”\n\nSimilarly, an NBC rep said in a statement, “Consistent with our policies, we have agreed to accept the ad if the inaccurate graphic – which refers to journalists as ‘fake news’ – is corrected.”\n\nA source confirmed CBS did not take the ad for its network as well.\n\nWatch the ad below.\n\n“Fake News” became a chant for Trump during his 2016 election campaign, and his relationship with mainstream media outlets has become more enflamed as he entered the White House.\n\nAs CNN anchor Jake Tapper laid out during a panel at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, this year, “I call ‘fake news’ three recent things: When Trump said nobody in his campaign spoke to Russia, and they did; when Michael Flynn said he didn’t have contact with the Russians, and he did, and now our attorney general said he didn’t speak to the Russians. … The White House wants to delegitimize any checks and balances.”","author":"Nick Romano","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T21:27:55.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i1.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-643904508.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Technology","digest":"DhM7rZ94XfuD69aGNdtogw==\n"}

Miguel will cock his head as she pulls out any number of looks that no mortal man could pull off — a star-spangled Speedo, a backward mesh tank top, and, in this case, a pajama onesie that fits in all the right places — and they’ll laugh together and clink glasses, confident in the knowledge that Miguel is no mortal man, but a sex alien sent down to grace our screens in the most spectacular garb imaginable.\n\nAfter two exciting episodes, “All I Want Right Now Is One More Bullet” sees many of our cluster kind of hanging out in their evening wear, which — let’s be clear here — I have no problem with whatsoever. And while Lito, Sun, Kala and Capheus deal with their little dramas while wearing the most adorable little lingerie, it seems that the other sensates are stuck dealing with more confusing and convoluted villain subplots. I’ve watched the episode twice and still don’t really know what’s going on. But why be bothered with details when Max Riemelt is naked?\n\nI was convinced that we’d have to deal with the showdown at Whispers’ mansion for most of the episode, but the final fight is delayed once again with the return of Jonas. Apparently, even though he took a bone saw to the head, he’s still at large. The mysterious chairman of BPO (we’re getting into Buffy Initiative territory here…be worried) seems to want Jonas alive as leverage against Whispers. While Dr. Milton may be the key to turning sensates into zombie assassins, he’s apparently a liability, and Jonas is BPO’s last fallback for stopping him. The entire cluster — like me — is confused, and rather than strike, they watch Milton and his family leave on a helicopter.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can return to the sweet stuff. Down in the Mexico City sex condo, Lito interrupts Dani and Hernando’s morning of frozen margaritas with a Jenna Maroney-level meltdown. He even pulls out a pint of ice cream — a sin for someone so vain. “How many gay action stars are there?” he asks, dejected. The other two pretty much roll their eyes. Finding no relief from his chosen family, he pays visits to his psychic relatives for attention.\n\nWhen Lito hits up Sun, who is now crashing at a Love Motel, he receives a prickly reception Without his Instagram followers, he has nothing. But she’s got it far worse. “What do I have?” she asks. “My parents are dead, my only brother will kill me if I don’t kill him first. If anyone should be laying on the bed crying, it should be me.” But Lito doesn’t move. “Maybe that’s why I’m here, Sun,” he says, offering her a hand to cry with him. They each grab a cat pillow and cuddle, and we are reminded why this show rules.\n\nCapheus receives a surprise in his sleep as well when the former Superpower Gang Boss shows up with a gun and wakes up his former nemesis. I know I’m supposed to be scared of this gun- and machete-wielding lunatic, but all I can focus on is Toby Onwumere in his little boxer shorts.\n\nIt seems that the newly political Capheus has been ruffling feathers, and with Shepard Fairey-style graffiti of the local hero with the word “courage” all over the streets, even the Boss Man of the mob has his eyes on Van Damme. But he leaves with a warning, and Capheus has to worry about what’s to come.\n\nA nervous Kala starts paying unsolicited visits to her cluster buddies as well. As Will starts to crack open his heroin stash, she stops him to ask for advice about Rajan. Let’s just try to ignore the fact that a main character of this show may be addicted to heroin with no real repercussions and try to focus on Kala’s love triangle. She’s considering telling Rajan everything because she knows something’s up with him after he shows up at home with a bloody nose. But does she even care that much about Rajan’s dirty dealings? “Do you want to tell him because you’re in love with someone else?” Will asks, totally reading her. She doesn’t tell Rajan, who seems to be completely imploding. While wearing her own Robyn Fenty-inspired evening look, she catches him on a very shady phone call. But it doesn’t seem to bother her too much. She’d rather have a psychic cuddle session with Wolfgang on the roof.","author":"David Goldberg","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T20:00:12.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i2.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/sense8_208_unit_01464_r2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"U+hICXgFk1Hhc6BtCTYmXg==\n"}

In narrating a scene between Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) in a video for The New York Times, writer-director James Gunn revealed that he wrote the action sequence as an homage to 1959’s North by Northwest.\n\n“I call this scene North by Northwest because it is referencing the great Hitchcock film, the crop duster scene in that movie,” Gunn says in voiceover. “I also think a lot of Spy vs. Spy. The scene is pretty long … they switch power positions many times throughout and things get a little bit more and more outlandish as time goes on.”\n\nThe filmmaker further reveals in an interview with the Times, “When I was writing the screenplay I originally wrote a different action sequence between Nebula and Gamora and I came upon the idea for this one, I think, through watching North by Northwest. I decided to rewrite the action sequence between the two of them.”\n\nWatch the famous crop duster scene from North by Northwest below to compare.\n\nGunn also took inspiration from Dwayne Johnson in Furious 7 for the moment when Gamora fires back with the ship’s gun. “I had seen The Rock do his thing with a giant blaster in Fast and Furious 7 and I decided to one up that with Zoe Saldana grabbing up a gun that’s eight times as big as The Rock’s gun in Fast and Furious,” he says.\n\nAs Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 continues its theatrical run this week, Sylvester Stallone also unveiled his cameo scene in a clip posted to Instagram.

The actor released his big cameo scene online as the film begins its theatrical run this weekend.\n\nThe footage was first released on ABC’s Good Morning America Friday before Stallone posted it to Instagram. In it, the Creed actor debuts as Stakar, a.k.a. Starhawk, a Ravager clan leader who has a past with Yondu (Michael Rooker). Stakar shouts in the clip how Yondu “betrayed the code” for dealing in children. You may recall how he picked up Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) on Earth when he was just a boy.\n\n“This Marvel movie was a wonderful experience led by the brilliant director James Gunn,” Stallone wrote. “Plus it was great to work with my old buddy, Michael Rooker from Cliffhanger days!”\n\nWatch below.\n\nThis Marvel movie was a wonderful experience Led by the brilliant director James Gunn Plus it was great to work with my old buddy, Michael Rooker from Cliffhanger days!#Guardian of the galaxy #MarvelUniverse #Yondu #Starhawk#StakerOgord#Ravager A post shared by Sly Stallone (@officialslystallone) on May 6, 2017 at 10:22am PDT\n\nStallone has a couple more brief appearances in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2, but this is his big introduction.\n\n“He was amazing, he really was,” writer-director James Gunn told EW. “It was a bit intimidating, I must admit. Because, as a kid I grew up, running around in my backyard, pretending I was Snake Plissken or pretending I was Johnny Rambo. Those were my heroes as a child. So, all of a sudden, having to direct Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone in a movie is quite an amazing experience.”\n\nRELATED: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has 5 post-credits scenes. Here’s what they all mean.\n\n“Sly’s the man,” Pratt said. “He’s been the man since the jump. That guy’s one of the most prolific creators in Hollywood and he’s been a hero of mine since I was a kid.”\n\nVol. 2 also features Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Pom Klementieff, Karen Gillan, and Sean Gunn.

I wanted to see one before I die,” he said — dedicating his trip to his late father.\n\n“I want to do all the things I wanted to do now that I survived that accident,” he continued. “And I’ve always wanted to do the Kentucky Derby.”\n\n“That accident” Morgan is referring to is his terrifying June 2014 bus crash, which took the life of his friend and mentor “Jimmy Mac” McNair and left Morgan fighting for his life in critical condition.\n\nAwaking from a coma two weeks later, the Saturday Night Live alum has faced countless physical hurdles in the three years since — having to re-learn how to walk, sit, and stand while grappling with the cognitive effects of traumatic brain injuries.\n\nHe doesn’t take a day for granted now, and said the accident gave him a new outlook on life. “It doesn’t cost nothing to be nice,” Morgan explained on Friday. “I know my purpose in this world is to spread love. I love you and you can’t do nothing about it.”\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Tracy Morgan Introduces PEOPLE to His 3-Year-Old Daughter\n\nAnd while Morgan hasn’t made his mind up yet on who he is rooting for at Saturday’s race, the Seabiscuit and Secretariat fan said he’s doing the Derby in memory of the late Barbaro — the 2007-winning horse who was euthanized after numerous injuries.\n\n“We loved him,” Morgan said — his wife Megan Wollover by his side. “I’m doing this one for Barbaro. I love you and miss you.”\n\nMorgan was just one of the celebrities at the star-studded gala, which was sponsored by G. H. Mumm. Despite a steady rain, the red carpet was filed with notable names — including Katie Couric, Kacey Musgraves, Harry Connick Jr., Giada De Laurentiis, Stephen Amell, and This is Us’ Justin Hartley.\n\nTom Brady arrived in a leather jacket, quickly gathering with his Super Bowl winning Patriots squad for a team photo — having missed the White House celebration in April.\n\nPackers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, meanwhile, gushed over Jeff Bridges on the red carpet.\n\nJesse Eisenberg was a last minute addition to the evening, driving down from Indiana where he’s filming his new television series The Market. His wife Anna Strout and their 5-month-old son joined him in Kentucky – though family watched the baby for the evening while mom and dad enjoyed a night out.\n\nInside the event — held at the private home of Patricia Barnstable Brown, who co-hosts the event with her twin sister Priscilla Barnstable — Eisenberg and Strout jammed while Brian McKnight covered Michael Jackson’s “Rock With You” on stage. Other guests mingled, drank and danced the night away.\n\nThe night’s biggest draw was its Hall of Fame jam session — with Kid Rock leading Van Halen’s Sammy Hagar, Bon Jovi’s Richie Sambora, Travis Tritt, Brooks and Dunn’s Kix Brooks and The Supremes’ singer Mary Wilson through a medley of impromptu tunes. In addition to classic tunes like “Sweet Home Alabama,” some of the singers’ most famous hits were covered — including Kid Rock’s “Cowboy,” Bon Jovi’s “Dead or Alive.”\n\nThe Barnstable Brown Gala is known for its musical extravaganza. Over the past ten years, the event has raised and donated approximately $13,000,000 to the Barnstable Brown Diabetes and Obesity Research Center at the University of Kentucky.\n\nPatricia and Priscilla co-founded the gala, along with Patricia’s late husband, Dr. David E.

{"_id":{"$oid":"590ec3fc9e4da44e454652a5"},"description":"French authorities began investigating the “piracy action” one day before the country’s most important presidential election in decades.","title":"Macron campaign says its emails have been subjected to ‘massive, coordinated’ hacking","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/macron-campaign-says-its-emails-have-been-subjected-to-massive-coordinated-hacking/2017/05/06/368c0460-31e1-11e7-a335-fa0ae1940305_story.html","text":"It was only the latest plot twist in a long, bitter campaign defined by rancor and uncertainty.\n\nThe day before France’s most momentous presidential election in recent history, authorities were still investigating the “massive and coordinated piracy action” that independent candidate Emmanuel Macron reported just minutes before the campaign’s official end Friday night.\n\nThe data dump, the Macron campaign said, involved thousands of nonincriminating emails and other internal communications — some of which, the campaign insisted, were fake. In a year of populist upheaval, this was the nightmare scenario for many observers, immediately reminiscent of the American election — in which, as U.S. intelligence agencies recently concluded, Russian President Vladimir Putin commissioned an “influence campaign” to benefit Donald Trump.\n\nThe identity of the hacker remains unconfirmed, but the parallels were clear enough in Paris and Washington: Macron, an independent centrist candidate and staunch defender of the European Union, is facing off against Marine Le Pen, a far-right populist whose party has relied on Russian banks in the past and who favors pivoting France’s foreign policy toward the Kremlin. In March, Le Pen met personally with Putin on a visit to Moscow.\n\n(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\n“Intervening in the last hour of the official campaign, this operation is obviously a democratic destabilization, as has already been seen in the United States during the last presidential campaign,” the Macron campaign said, stopping short of assigning blame.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed across the Atlantic, with Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Ca.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, warning that the hacking, if successful, “would represent yet another dangerous escalation of cyberinterference in a Western nation’s democracy.”\n\nBut amid France’s government-mandated day of silence that always precedes election day — when candidates are strictly prohibited from campaigning in any way — the impact of the leaks on the election remained to be seen.\n\nIn the French press, the leaks received comparatively little coverage: In keeping with French campaign law, reporting on the emails’ contents could result in criminal charges. On Saturday, France’s electoral commission urged journalists and media organizations to heed “the sense of responsibility they must demonstrate, as at stake are the free expression of voters and the sincerity of the election” itself.\n\nBen Nimmo, a research fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, said in an interview that enthusiasm for the leaks was scarcely discernible beyond the far-right, pro-Le Pen online circles that had circulated them in the first place.\n\n“It doesn't seem at this stage that there are lots of high-profile non-Le Pen accounts jumping in and spreading the message around,” he said of social-media patterns surrounding the leaks. “They have kept their constituency — and they have galvanized their constituency — but they haven't necessarily stepped outside of that constituency.”\n\nMost French voters interviewed on the streets of the capital the day before the vote shrugged off the hack. The stakes are much too high to be bothered by compromising internal campaign documents, they said.\n\nPaul Lotere, a 29-year-old civil servant, said he was most upset that Macron had no chance to respond given the strict campaign curfew. He plans to vote for the former finance and economy minister and said he has no interest in the documents until their veracity is confirmed.\n\n“Ah, yes, ‘hashtag Macron leaks,’” sneered Alain Chappotteau, a 51-year-old psychologist, repeating the Twitter tagline popularizing the news. “With all the fuss, all the tricks, in this campaign, what’s one more? I’m voting for my child’s future. This doesn’t matter.”\n\nAlthough the hacker remained unknown, Nimmo said, the social-media campaign following the Macron data dump originated in the United States, in a well-known network of alt-right Twitter accounts.\n\nThe #MacronLeaks Twitter storm — notably in English, not French — largely began with the account of Jack Posobiec, a Washington-based correspondent for the alt-right website TheRebel.media, Nimmo said. Posobiec has written that he served, in 2016, as “Special Projects Director of Citizens for Trump, the largest Trump grassroots organization in the US,” according to an article Nimmo wrote on the Macron case.\n\nFrom there, Nimmo said, news of the Macron leaks — allegedly containing details of offshore accounts and tax evasion — was retweeted by William Craddick, another alt-right activist known to have spread in December a fake news story about German Chancellor Angela Merkel tolerating Islamic State terrorists to deploy an E.U. “army” to subdue her country's neighbors. Eventually, Nimmo added, the leaks began to be retweeted by well-known National Front accounts — reaching 47,000 tweets in just three hours.\n\nDespite France's strict prohibition on campaigning after the deadline, Florian Philippot, the National Front's deputy leader, tweeted early Saturday morning: “Will #Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?”\n\nFor months now, Le Pen has also received exceedingly positive coverage in Russian state media. Meanwhile, those news outlets have pilloried Macron, accusing him of being secretly gay and of embezzling public funds. To date, most of those rumors seem to have had little effect on French voters.\n\nThroughout the election, Macron has frequently said that his campaign has been the target of Russian meddling, though the Kremlin has repeatedly denied those accusations.\n\nIn a report issued last month, researchers at the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro linked intrusions into the Macron campaign’s online network to Russian hackers operating as an arm of Kremlin intelligence. The Tokyo-based firm said it was the same group — known variously as Pawn Storm, APT28 and Fancy Bear — that hacked the Democratic National Committee and officials tied to Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful campaign for president.\n\nIn the specific case of the leaked documents, a Russian connection was not immediately identified. But according to analysis conducted by Flashpoint Intel, a digital risk firm, “it appears to be linked to the Russian state-sponsored campaign by APT28.”\n\nNicolas Vanderbiest, an expert on social-media information dissemination and the author of the well-known blog “Reputatio Lab,” said in an interview that there were significant connections in the Twitter storm following the leaks to accounts linked to Sputnik and Russia Today. In a paper published several weeks ago, he studied many of these accounts, some 40 percent of which were involved with spreading the news about the Macron scandal early Saturday, he said.\n\nIn any case, analysts say, the French government has taken the threat of cybersecurity in the election very seriously.\n\nIn March, for instance, France’s National Cybersecurity Agency said that there was “an extremely high risk” of cyberattacks and hacking of the country’s electoral process, which prompted the government to suspend electronic voting this year for French citizens overseas.\n\nAlexander Klimburg, an expert on cyberwarfare at The Hague Centre for Security Studies who has been in regular contact with French civil service officers, said he believes the French government is sufficiently prepared for Russian cyberattacks, especially after Russian hackers nearly destroyed a French television network, TV5Monde, almost exactly two years ago.\n\n“The sense was, ‘If this happens again, we’re going to be ready,’ ” Klimburg said. “I expect there to be a massive escalation in the covert information environment.”\n\nPolls show Macron, a former investment banker and Socialist finance minister, with a considerable lead over Le Pen, at 63 percent to 37 percent of the vote, according to the latest analysis from the Ipsos firm, released Friday.\n\nFor many, the hacking and subsequent data dump represented a desperate, last-dash attempt to thwart Macron’s considerable lead in the polls — a lead that has actually grown in the final days of the campaign.\n\n“It's so obvious, and you can make all the connections so easily,” said Vanderbiest. “It's very amateur.”\n\nRead more\n\nObama endorses Macron in French election, taking a side in Europe again\n\nEmmanuel Macron is 39 and his wife is 64.

But the leader of Boko Haram scoffed at the world’s sudden attention to Nigeria’s upheaval and shrugged off the global outrage, vowing to sell the girls in the market and “give their hands in marriage because they are our slaves.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We would marry them out at the age of 9,” warned the group’s leader, Abubakar Shekau. “We would marry them out at the age of 12.”\n\nUntil now, only about 22 of the girls have been found or released. And even with the dozens believed to be released on Saturday, well over 100 girls are still thought to be in Boko Haram’s clutches, many possibly married to fighters or forced to become combatants themselves. Previously released girls have told family members that some of the girls from Chibok have died in childbirth or in military raids.\n\nBeyond that, many hundreds, if not thousands, of other girls and boys have been abducted by Boko Haram over the years, forcing them to fight, to cook, to clean and to bear children. Pregnant young women, a woman with a baby on her back and even children as young as 7 or 8 have been used as suicide bombers by the group, deployed as human weapons who have brought destruction to markets and even camps of desperate people fleeing the violence.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Government officials had indicated that they were negotiating for the release of more of the girls from Chibok.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOfficials have known the whereabouts of some of the girls for more than a year. Western diplomats had said that intelligence showed months ago that a group of dozens of the girls had been moved to a spot near the border with Cameroon. Sending in soldiers to free them was not a viable option because of worries that the fighters would kill the girls, or the girls would be killed during the operation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari vowed repeatedly to bring the girls home, but in recent months he has been ill, spending several weeks at the start of the year in Britain for undisclosed medical reasons. The release of the girls would bolster the presidency of the ailing Mr. Buhari, who has missed recent cabinet meetings though he was seen in public late last week.\n\nThe search for the missing girls has gone through may twists and turns over the years, sometimes resulting in false reports of progress. At times, government and military officials have been quoted in the Nigerian news media as saying that a cease-fire deal had been struck with the militants or that the release of the kidnapped girls had been arranged, statements that later proved to be untrue.\n\n“I need to see it myself,” said Yakubu Nkeki, chairman of the Abducted Chibok Girls Parents Movement for Rescue, one of several groups working for the release of all the girls.","author":"Dionne Searcey","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T00:05:41.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/07/world/07BOKO/07BOKO-facebookJumbo.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"8dCwhwsrU7w9DuV0rSCgng==\n"}

Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), on Saturday criticized Wells Fargo \u0026 Co (WFC.N) for failing to stop employees from signing up customers for bogus accounts even after learning it was happening, causing a scandal.\n\nWells Fargo, whose largest shareholder is Berkshire with a 10 percent stake worth roughly $27 billion, gave employees too much autonomy to engage in \"cross-selling\" multiple products to meet sales goals, Buffett said.\n\nThis \"incentivized the wrong type of behavior,\" and former Chief Executive John Stumpf, who lost his job over the scandal, was too slow to fix the problem, Buffett said.\n\nWells Fargo was among many topics discussed at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, where Buffett, 86, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 93, fielded dozens of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts.\n\n\"If there's a major problem, the CEO will get wind of it. At that moment, that's the key to everything. The CEO has to act,\" Buffett said. \"The main problem was they didn't act when they learned about it.\"\n\nStill, Buffett's support of current management and board was key to ensuring the re-election of the entire board last month.\n\nWells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said \"we agree\" with Buffett's comments, and have taken \"decisive actions\" to fix the problems and \"make things right for customers.\"\n\nBuffett likened the situation to Salomon Brothers Inc, where in 1991 he was installed as chairman to clean up a mess after the former chief executive failed to tell regulators a trader was submitting fake bids at Treasury auctions.\n\nAsked whether Berkshire's decentralized structure could lead to a similar scandal, Buffett said \"as we sit here, somebody is doing something wrong at Berkshire,\" whose units employ 367,000 people. But he said Berkshire has an internal \"hotline\" to flag possible misbehavior, which gets 4,000 calls a year.\n\nSUCCESSION, DIVIDENDS\n\nThe meeting also included discussions about Berkshire's succession plans, its controversial partnership with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, and whether it will start paying dividends or make a monster acquisition.\n\nBuffett has said Berkshire could have a new chief executive within 24 hours if he died or could not continue, and that nothing had changed just because he praised fewer managers than usual in his February shareholder letter.\n\nHe said it may have been harder to single people out because \"we have never had more good managers.\"\n\nBut he also said it would be a \"terrible mistake\" if capital allocation were not the \"main talent\" of his successor.\n\nBuffett did lavish much praise on top insurance executive Ajit Jain, who some investors believe could be that successor, saying \"nobody could possibly replace Ajit. You can't come close.\"\n\nOn 3G, with which Berkshire controls Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and tried to merge it with Unilever NV (ULVR.L)(UNc.AS), Buffett acknowledged a dislike for the cost-cutting for which the Brazilian firm is known.\n\nBut, he said, \"it is absolutely essential to America that we become more productive, and 3G was \"very good at making a business productive with fewer people.\"\n\nBuffett also raised the possibility Berkshire could pay its first dividend since 1967, if \"reasonably soon, even while I'm around,\" the company had too much cash it could not reasonably deploy.\n\n\"It could be repurchases, it could be dividends,\" he said.\n\nBerkshire ended March with more than $96 billion of cash and cash-like instruments, and Munger said it could do a \"$150 billion\" acquisition now if it wanted.\n\nAIRLINES, IBM\n\nBuffett defended Berkshire's foray into airlines, where it is a top investor in American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N).\n\nHe had long disdained the industry, which had gone through many bankruptcies, but said he is confident it will not resort to \"suicidally competitive\" pricing strategies that could spell doom.\n\nMunger added: \"You've got to remember railroads were a terrible business for decades and decades and decades, and then they got good.\" Berkshire bought the BNSF railroad in 2010.\n\nBuffett also admitted he was wrong to think International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) \"would do better\" when he started amassing 81 million shares six years ago.\n\nBerkshire recently sold about one-third of those shares even as it built a huge stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which Buffett said is more as a \"consumer\" company than a technology company.\n\nHe also addressed criticism that Berkshire discloses too little about businesses such as aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, which it bought last year for $32.1 billion.\n\n\"We want you to understand what you own,\" he said, and \"there are just a million things that are of minor importance\" at Berkshire, whose market value is about $411 billion.\n\nBuffett also noted that Berkshire reported far fewer investment gains in the first quarter, which dragged on results, but said the company now has a slight preference for taking tax losses, which could lose value if Washington lawmakers reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate.\n\nShareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have required Berkshire to disclose its political contributions twice a year.\n\nThe annual meeting, expected to draw more than last year's estimated 37,000 shareholders, is the main event of a weekend of events that Buffett calls \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\"\n\nBuffett and Munger took questions after the traditional shareholder movie, and after Buffett had roamed a nearby exhibit hall featuring products from Berkshire companies.\n\nHe was joined at the traditional newspaper tossing contest by friends including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder and Berkshire director Bill Gates and Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh.\n\nHundreds of shareholders lined up early outside downtown Omaha's CenturyLink Center for the meeting. Several said they got there nearly five hours before doors opened around 6:45 a.m.\n\n\"Every year it seems I have to come earlier,\" said Chris Tesari, a retired businessman from Pacific Palisades, California who said he arrived at 3:20 a.m. for his 21st meeting. \"It's a pilgrimage.\"\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Nick Zieminski)","author":"Jonathan Stempel","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T23:42:12.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20170506\u0026t=2\u0026i=1183503656\u0026w=\u0026fh=545px\u0026fw=\u0026ll=\u0026pl=\u0026sq=\u0026r=LYNXMPED450C9","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"3V8B+ZQpYKMLny3RrjWvdw==\n"}

Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), the centrist who negotiated the amendment that helped bring the House GOP’s healthcare bill over the finish line, expects his town hall next Wednesday could get rowdy.\n\nMacArthur noted the event is being held in Willingboro, N.J., where he only won 10 percent of the vote in the last election.\n\n“This is a not a town that’s going to perhaps be thrilled with this. But I will meet my constituents and talk to them and tell them why and help them understand that what they hear in the media and what fearmongerers are trying to whip up is simply not the truth,” MacArthur said just off the House floor after Thursday’s 217-213 vote on the healthcare bill.\n\nMacArthur has risen in prominence since crafting an amendment to the healthcare legislation with conservative House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) that would allow states to apply for waivers from key ObamaCare provisions.\n\nThe amendment to the bill gives states the chance to be exempted from rules that prevent insurance companies from charging sick people higher premiums and that mandate the services health plans must cover. To win a waiver, a state would have to meet certain conditions, including offering high-risk pools of insurance coverage for the sick.\n\nThe change has heightened the controversy surrounding the bill, with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel making waves nationally with an emotional late-night monologue about pre-existing conditions where he talked of his son’s congenital heart disease.\n\nGOP lawmakers facing the public are arming themselves with one primary message: they had to do something besides keep the status quo of ObamaCare.\n\n“This bill isn’t perfect. It doesn’t include every single component I wanted. But it came down to the [GOP bill] or the continued disaster of ObamaCare, which was an easy choice,” House GOP Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers Cathy McMorris RodgersGOP braces for healthcare blowback at home Congress must end governing by crisis Key GOP reps will back ObamaCare repeal bill with new amendment MORE (R-Wash.) wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Friday.\n\nRepublicans have pointed to the announcement this week that Medica, the last insurance carrier for most of Iowa, will likely stop selling individual health policies in the state due to market instability, as evidence the health system needs fixing. Aetna is also pulling out of Virginia’s individual insurance market due to expected financial losses.\n\n“This is the truth of ObamaCare self-destructing before us,” Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) said.\n\nMacArthur is among the few Republicans planning to talk with constituents in a town hall setting during the 11-day House recess that lasts through May 15.\n\nAs of Friday, only about a dozen Republicans had announced in-person town hall meetings over the recess, according to a list compiled by the Town Hall Project.\n\nSo far, all are Republicans who voted for the legislation but mostly represent safely red districts, like Reps. Dave Brat (Va.), Thomas Garrett (Va.), Raul Labrador (Idaho), Chris Stewart Chris StewartGOP braces for healthcare blowback at home Transgender candidate Misty Snow announces House bid in Utah GOP rep faces jeers, protests at Utah town hall MORE (Utah) and James Comer (Ky.).\n\nLabrador's first town hall of the recess on Friday in a deep-red district quickly turned raucous.\n\nAttendees shouted \"liar!\" at him as he discussed health care, according to an Idaho Public Radio reporter.\n\nReps. Rod Blum (Iowa), Don Bacon (Neb.) and MacArthur are the only Republicans to schedule town halls so far who are on the House Democratic campaign arm’s target list for the 2018 elections.\n\nMost of the vulnerable Republicans who voted for the healthcare bill on Thursday haven’t announced plans for town hall meetings.\n\nRep. David Young (R-Iowa), for instance, has held 17 town meetings in his district this year. But his office declined to say if he would host any during the recess.\n\nAnd House Republicans who backed the bill and hail from districts that were won by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonGOP braces for healthcare blowback at home Warren Buffett: Trump-style tax cut would benefit shareholders How to fix fractured politics? For starters, watch hockey MORE, including Reps. Darrell Issa (Calif.), Jeff Denham (Calif.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), have not announced plans for district town meetings in the coming days, either.\n\nThat’s not stopping progressive groups from staging protests to make their anger clear over Thursday’s vote.\n\nDemocrats in Rep. Pete King’s (R-N.Y.) Long Island district are holding a “Women’s Town Hall” to “discuss the major concerns that women in his district have about the policies of the current administration and what actions the congressman plans to take,” according to the group’s Facebook page.\n\nAnd constituents in Rep. Mimi Walters’s (R-Calif.) district, which went for Clinton, created a Facebook group to pressure her to hold an open forum and invited her to a town hall on Tuesday.\n\nA coalition of progressive groups — Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Organizing for Action, MoveOn.org, and Center for American Progress Action Fund — are coordinating more than 75 events nationwide through the weekend in response to Thursday’s vote.\n\n“Phones will ring off the hook; district offices will be jammed full of angry constituents,” MoveOn.org Washington Director Ben Wikler said.\n\nDespite the pushback he expects at his town hall, MacArthur is defending his role in crafting the bill regardless of what might happen in his swing district that went for both President Trump and former President Obama.\n\n“If I looked at this through a political lens only, then you never get anything done, if that’s the only calculation,” MacArthur said.","author":"Cristina Marcos","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T20:22:39.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/townhallbacklash_resist_033117getty.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"DkepXCI5vNt9ZxCgHZRkHw==\n"}

However, officials said there were no indications of foul play after a preliminary investigation at the Olympic Training Center where Holcomb was found in his room. An autopsy was tentatively scheduled for Sunday.\n\nThe native of Park City, Utah, was a three-time Olympian, and his signature moment came at the 2010 Vancouver Games when he piloted his four-man sled to a win that snapped a 62-year gold-medal drought for the U.S. in bobsled’s signature race.\n\n“It would be easy to focus on the loss in terms of his Olympic medals and enormous athletic contributions to the organization, but USA Bobsled and Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend,” said Darrin Steele, the federation’s CEO who had known Holcomb for two decades.\n\nHolcomb also drove to bronze medals in both two- and four-man events at the Sochi Games in 2014, and was expected to be part of the 2018 U.S. Olympic team headed to the Pyeongchang Games.\n\nHe also was a former world champion in both two-man and four-man competition.\n\n“The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb,” U.S. Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said. “Steve was a tremendous athlete and even better person, and his perseverance and achievements were an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve’s family and the entire bobsledding community.”\n\nHolcomb was still one of the world’s elite drivers, finishing second on the World Cup circuit in two-man points and third in four-man points this past season. His final victory came in Lake Placid last December, when he drove to a two-man win.\n\nHe was cherubic, almost always happy in public, someone whose sense of humor was well-known throughout the close-knit bobsled world. Teammates even spent a season chronicling his “Holcy Dance,” a little less-than-rhythmic shuffle that he would do at each stop on the World Cup circuit to make fellow sliders laugh.\n\nBut at race time, Holcomb turned icy serious.\n\nHe won 60 World Cup medals, plus 10 more at the world championships and three in the Olympics, making him one of the most decorated pilots in the world. And when he teamed with Steven Langton to win Olympic bronze in two-man at Sochi in 2014, he snapped another 62-year U.S. drought in that event — just as he had four years earlier in the four-man Olympic race.\n\n“If anyone else has a 62-year medal drought you need to break, let me know, I’ll help you,” Holcomb said at the time.\n\nHis winter-sports career started as a skier when he was 6, and he started as a push athlete in bobsled in 1998. He was an alternate on the 2002 Olympic team, and has been the driver of USA-1 — the honor bestowed to America’s best pilot — for more than a decade.\n\nHis death quickly resonated through the Olympic community.\n\n“Incredibly sad to hear about the passing of @StevenHolcomb,”\n\nU.S. women’s soccer star Carli Lloyd tweeted. “Deepest sympathies go out to his loved ones.”\n\nHolcomb revealed in recent years that there was also a troubled side, including battles with depression and a failed hotel-room suicide attempt in 2007 which he wrote about in his autobiography, “But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold.”\n\n“After going through all that and still being here, I realized what my purpose was,” Holcomb told the AP in a 2014 interview.\n\nThe depression, he believed, largely stemmed from his fight with the disease called keratoconus. Holcomb’s vision degenerated to the point where he was convinced that his bobsled career was ending, and his mood quickly started going dark as well. His eyesight was saved in a surgery that turned his 20-500 vision into something close to perfect, and his sliding career simply took off from there.\n\nWinning gold with push athletes Steve Mesler, Curt Tomasevicz and Justin Olsen at the Vancouver Olympics turned Holcomb into a full-fledged star. In the months that followed, Holcomb met President Barack Obama, played golf with Charles Barkley, hung out with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes — they were then a couple— visited the New York Stock Exchange, threw the ceremonial first pitch at a Cleveland Indians game and went to the Indianapolis 500.\n\nIn the bobsled world, he was larger than life.\n\n“Dreadful, dreadful news,” bobsledding broadcaster Martin Haven said on Twitter. “Holcy was one of the friendliest, most open guys you could hope to meet... I’m heartbroken.”\n\nFuneral arrangements were not immediately announced.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T00:17:17.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"//a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/sports/2017/05/06/us-olympian-bobsledder-steven-holcomb-37-found-dead/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1494114986964.jpg?ve=1","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"hFUvNTTrE1AuIinZ5tIDyQ==\n"}

Stay loyal to a failing government too long and you risk going down with it. But if you break with the government and others don’t, you’ll pay a high price for disloyalty.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis may be as old as politics itself. Plato, the 4th-century B.C. Greek philosopher, wrote that a united elite could resist popular uprisings, but that when the ruling class fractured, power could change hands.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMembers of the elite, in this game, try to test one another over where they stand, as well as the government’s strength, in order to decide whether to remain loyal. If enough believe they have achieved critical mass to force a leadership change, they will all push at once.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLuisa Ortega, the attorney general, conducted such a test, whether she intended to or not, in late March. When the pro-Maduro Supreme Court moved to seize many of the legislature’s powers, Ms. Ortega condemned the ruling as a “rupture of the constitutional order.”\n\nThe government faced a dilemma. Tolerating Ms. Ortega’s dissent would signal that elites could more freely break with Mr. Maduro, making action against him easier. But punishing her would risk backlash from any elites who shared her view.\n\nMs. Ortega went unpunished, and the ruling was reversed.\n\n“It’s a sign of enormous weakness inside the ruling clique that Luisa Ortega took the position that she did and kept her job,” said Francisco Toro, a Venezuelan political scientist who edits the Caracas Chronicles website. “That’s never happened before.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRapid policy changes can open such fissures by forcing elites to decide whether to go along.

But by conferring pre-emptive legitimacy, they signal to potential coup leaders that they would enjoy at least some elite support.\n\nStill, the government has been preparing its defenses since 2002. That year, amid major protests, Hugo Chávez, Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, ordered the military to impose order. It instead removed him in a coup that was quickly reversed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter that, Mr. Chávez packed the military with allies.\n\nThe military also gained vast patronage streams, which some local officials say include control over gold mining.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut 2002 also provided a warning that authoritarian leaders have learned repeatedly throughout history. Even a loyal military, when forced to resolve a political crisis, might decide against the leader who called it in.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe impossibility of fully predicting how the military might decide in another crisis, along with growing unrest that could again test it, has left the government nervous.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast year, Cliver Alcalá, a retired major general, called for a referendum to unseat Mr. Maduro. Though Mr. Maduro ordered his arrest, Mr. Alcalá remains free and a vocal critic, although still under pressure.

The next month, they turned up in Colombia, where they requested asylum.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has publicly demanded their return, which Mr. Levitsky called “pretty clear evidence that the government is worried about some sort of conspiracy” within the ranks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBecause the government cannot be sure whether these voices represent wider opposition within the military, it has to guess at how severely to silence them — a guessing game it cannot afford to get wrong.\n\nA Shrinking Pie\n\nBut Mr. Maduro can also play this game. He has enabled loyalists to profit from corruption and patronage, giving them a financial stake in the government’s survival.\n\nPhoto\n\nLoyalty was once purchased with oil revenue, but today, Mr. Toro said, the most valuable resource in Venezuela is access to favorable exchange rates. By leveraging official government rates, which value the bolívar considerably higher than the unofficial rate, someone with the proper connections can generate a small fortune out of thin air.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDrug and food smuggling also generate revenue, including for the military.\n\nBut as the economy worsens, elites compete over a smaller pie.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“When elites begin to compete among themselves, usually somebody defects,” Mr. Levitsky said, using the formal term for an elite who turns against the government.\n\nVenezuela is also growing internationally isolated, forcing elites to fear they could face foreign sanctions or even criminal charges if they remain loyal and the government falls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs threats mount, Mr. Levitsky said, “even actors who were bought off with patronage tend to worry.”\n\nThis is part of what makes the lack of widespread defection, amid Venezuela’s economic collapse, so unusual.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMaduro’s Secret Weapon\n\nPressed to explain Mr. Maduro’s resilience, Mr. Levitsky cited one of the only forces more powerful than economic self-interest: ideological polarization.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Chavez’s hypercharged populism succeeded in so dividing society that crossing over remains, for many, unthinkable. And so ideological dedication remains widespread, including among elites.\n\n“Defection is harder when the other side isn’t just some guy you disagree with about tax policy but rather is the enemy,” Mr. Levitsky said. “Moving to opposition, calling for Maduro’s fall, is still akin to treason. That atmosphere makes defection much harder.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZimbabwe, Mr. Levitsky said, might be the only other country whose government survived similar collapse. Its leader, Robert Mugabe, maintained elite support by framing his fight against dissent as a continuation of the revolutionary movement he had led against the white-supremacist colonial regime in Rhodesia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat same fervor could create an opportunity for dissidents, however. Venezuela’s few defecting elites have tended to portray themselves as the true guardians of Mr. Chávez’s cause and Mr. Maduro as the traitor.\n\nThis past week, Ms. Ortega told The Wall Street Journal that Mr. Maduro’s move for a new Constitution was an attack on “Chávez’s Constitution” — portraying Mr. Maduro as the one who had betrayed the system.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe country’s widespread shortages of food and medicine could also provide an opening for Ms. Ortega and other defectors to claim that the government is not fulfilling its socialist mission.\n\nAnd younger, second-tier Chávistas may worry about Mr. Maduro’s damage to the cause and its longevity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“These guys have a stake in preserving some semblance of political capital in Chávismo,” Mr. Levitsky said.\n\nThis is why coups are often led by colonels or civilians of equivalent rank, who also enjoy fewer fruits of patronage and so face less downside in defecting.\n\nBut movement can come only when elites, junior or senior, are sure they have the numbers to win. And any contest over ideological loyalty will tilt toward the status quo. The rules of the game still favor Mr. Maduro, even if the state of play does not.","author":"Amanda Taub and Max Fisher","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T23:26:26.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/07/world/07int-venezuela1/07int-venezuela1-facebookJumbo.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"iEFSt3eEXaZvMBsK5Aap5g==\n"}

He was released after posting bond on a $300,000 bail.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Balch Springs, a working-class suburb of 25,000 southeast of Dallas, the shooting has threatened to widen the divide between the majority-white police force and the community’s black and Latino residents.\n\nIn recent years, a number of black residents have accused officers of using excessive force and have sued the department in federal court for civil rights violations, but many of those cases have been dismissed. And although the city is majority black and Hispanic, only a handful of the department’s nearly 40 police officers are either black or Hispanic.\n\n“That’s unacceptable,” said Cedric W.

Tom Reed of New York, who was among the Republican members of Congress to vote for a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, held a string of hometown forums on Saturday where he was lambasted by crowds of angry voters and signs that read, \"GOP Disaster\" and \"Why do you want to kill my daughter?\"\n\nReed, whose district in upstate New York includes the cities of Ithaca and Corning, held three town hall meetings where the overwhelming majority of attendees had questions about health care. The congressman was met with boos and jeers throughout the forums, with people repeatedly chanting \"Shame!\" and \"Vote him out!\"\n\nAt the event in the town of Busti, a couple hundred people packed into a small firehouse holding up signs that read, \"Agree,\" \"Disagree\" or \"Lies,\" depending on Reed's answers. Some of the harsher signs read, \"This is not a victory lap. This is a walk of shame\" and \"Fire Reed.\"\n\nOne man, who had recently donated his kidney, said he was told he's now considered to have a pre-existing condition.\n\n\"Now that I have a pre-existing condition, my cost of health care could go up significantly or I could lose health care,\" he said to Reed in front of the crowd in Busti.\n\nAnother person in the room interrupted the man, calling him a \"hero\" for his kidney donation and then said he was being \"punished\" for his good deed.\n\nOn Thursday, the House of Representatives narrowly passed the the American Health Care Act on a 217-213 vote, with all Democrats and 20 Republicans voting no. The measure, which would repeal large parts of former President Barack Obama's legacy legislation, is now before the Senate.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Reed hailed the House's passage of the health care plan as \"a great victory\" that will provide property tax relief for New Yorkers \"who are unfairly forced to foot the bill for Medicaid.\"\n\n\"Today is a great victory for the American people. We are finally on the path to fixing our broke and broken health care system,\" Reed said.\n\nThe congressman also said the American Health Care Act \"upholds protections for pre-existing conditions and the expansion of Medicaid, which help our most vulnerable populations,\" although one of the most controversial provisions of the bill would give the states the option of seeking a waiver to allow insurance companies to raise premiums for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nReed was among the first Republican House members to confront angry constituents at town hall meetings this weekend. Other Republican as well as Democrat House members are scheduled to hold more town hall meetings in their home districts around the country in the coming days.\n\nPhotos posted on social media show Reed addressing his first town hall of the day in Dunkirk, with some people holding signs declaring: \"Keep your profits off my healthcare,\" \"So long farewell Tom Reed\" and \"No conscience no heart.\"\n\nAt Tom Reed's town hall meeting.

Nelson claimed that 300,000 people in northeast Wisconsin could lose their insurance if the American Health Care Act becomes law.\n\n\"This is a big deal. Three hundred thousand people in Northeast Wisconsin,\" Nelson told the governor.\n\n\"If you want to run for Congress, you had your chance,\" Walker said, repeating essentially the same reply several times during their exchange.\n\nNelson, a Democrat, ran unsuccessfully for Congress last year, losing to Republican Mike Gallagher, who voted in favor of the American Health Care Act.\n\nWalker also told Nelson that the House bill is not something that Wisconsin has to deal with at this point.\n\n\"It's not in front of us right now. It's not in front of this stage,\" Walker continued. \"The plan is, I'm going to wait for what the Senate and the president do and see from there.\"\n\nTheir conversation was captured on video by ABC affiliate WBAY and continues for several minutes.\n\nNext steps for the health care bill\n\nThe American Health Care Act is now before the Senate, and the Senate Budget Committee must review it to determine which portions are in compliance with the rules of reconciliation, under which the bill only requires 51 Senate votes for approval.\n\nRepublicans hold a slim majority in the Senate but several members are already wary of the health care plan.\n\n“At the end of the day, I think it'll be a Senate bill and then those two bills at some point will have to come together and we'll get started on that Senate bill immediately,” Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, a member of Senate leadership, told ABC News on Thursday.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn said the Trump administration has its work cut out for it to push the bill through the Senate, but he doesn't think they'll be starting over on the legislation.\n\n\"I don't think there's a start from scratch,\" Dearborn told ABC News' Political Director Rick Klein and Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl on the \"Powerhouse Politics\" podcast.\n\n\"Will there be some changes? Of course, the Senate is a different animal than the House,\" he continued. \"But I think we feel really good where we are. There's a proposal that will now go the Senate. We'll work with Senate leadership and the committee chairmen and the rank and file.\"","author":"ABC News","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T00:00:00.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/RT-healthcare-protest-2-jt-170506_16x9_992.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"E306/yQ4k8bgxBRvDTGmKA==\n"}

It has also dropped explicit language calling for Israel's destruction, though it retains the goal of eventually \"liberating\" all of historic Palestine, which includes what is now Israel.\n\nHamas has ruled Gaza since 2007, after securing an overwhelming victory in legislative elections the previous year and ending 40 years of political domination by its rival Fatah party. Hamas captured the coastal strip by violently overthrowing forces loyal to the Fatah movement, led by Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nIsrael, along with Egypt, has been enforcing a crippling border blockade against them since then. Though it has softened some of its rhetoric, Hamas' new platform clung to the hard-line positions that led to its isolation. The group reaffirmed it would not recognize Israel, renounce violence or recognize previous interim Israeli-Palestinian peace deals — the West's long-standing conditions for dealing with Hamas.\n\nIn its founding charter, Hamas called for setting up an Islamic state in historic Palestine, or the territory between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, which also includes Israel. It also included anti-Jewish references.\n\nAttacks on Israel\n\nOver the years, Hamas has carried out shootings, suicide bombings and rocket attacks against Israel. Since 2008, Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza have fought three cross-border wars. Abbas has been an outspoken opponent of violence, saying it undercuts Palestinian interests. Repeated reconciliation efforts between the Palestinian factions have failed. Hamas has sharply criticized Abbas' political program, which rests on setting up a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War.\n\nHaniyeh's selection marks the final phase of the secretive Hamas elections.\n\nIn February, the group chose militant commander Yehiya Sinwar, one of its most hard-line figures, as its new Gaza chief in charge of the group's core power base.\n\nHaniyeh, 54, was born in the al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza. He was the private secretary of Hamas' founder and spiritual leader, Ahmed Yassin.\n\nIn 2006, after Hamas won the legislative elections, Haniyeh was chosen by the movement to form its first government. He resigned as prime minister after Hamas and Fatah agreed to form a unity government in 2014 — a government that has never taken hold.\n\nFor the past four years, he has served as Mashaal's deputy.\n\nHamas-Fatah friction\n\nHaniyeh's first task will be to cope with escalating tensions between Hamas and Fatah. In recent weeks, Abbas has threatened to exert financial pressure, including cutting wage payments and aid to Gaza, as a way of forcing Hamas to cede ground.\n\nGaza resident Rani Abu Samra said he hoped Haniyeh's election could bridge gaps with Fatah and mark \"a new beginning for a real reconciliation on the internal Palestinian level.\"\n\nIn Gaza, where Haniyeh still resides in his home in a refugee camp, some residents saw his election as a sign that could draw attention to the territory's woes.\n\n\"If someone is from outside Gaza, he won't talk about Gaza's ordeals and worries properly,\" said Ahmed Okasha, a Gaza vendor.\n\nSince quitting his longtime base in Damascus in 2012, Mashaal has mostly lived in lavish suites in the capital of the oil-rich gulf state of Qatar.\n\nMkhaimar Abusada, a professor of political science at Gaza's al-Azhar University, said Haniyeh was a natural successor to Mashaal and represented \"a continuation for the moderate line in Hamas.\"\n\nIsrael had no immediate comment.","author":"Associated Press","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T00:00:00.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"https://gdb.voanews.com/2FA7655F-24E4-41F0-86A2-247B8FC95F71_mw1024_mh1024_r1_s.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"LKtS1m/z1Y5qdEZKVQukcQ==\n"}

We break down where Star-Lord and the gang might be heading next. We break down where Star-Lord and the gang might be heading next.\n\nThe end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 had big consequences and a whopping five post-credits scenes to set up what’s coming next. Let’s break down what it all means!\n\nFull spoilers follow for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\n\nPeter Quill finally meets his father and it turns out ol’ dad is a Celestial space god (with a little “g”) named Ego, and the big twist is that Ego needs Peter to help him take over the universe and keep him company. Peter taps into the power passed on to him from Ego to brawl with his dad while the rest of the Guardians destroy the cosmic brain at the core of Ego’s planet. In the end, the Guardians succeed, but new member and surrogate father-figure Yondu sacrifices himself to save Peter. So basically, Peter met his biological father only to find out that the only dad he needed was there all along! Yondu’s heroic death also redeems him for breaking the Ravager code all those years before.\n\nWhile we did see Yondu die, there’s actually a small chance he could return. One of the post-credits scenes sees Sylvester Stallone’s character Stakar Ogord assembling the original Ravagers. Stakar is actually the Marvel antihero known as Starhawk and a member of the original comic book Guardians of the Galaxy, who are from an alternate future in the 31st century. The other members present are Martinex (Michael Rosenbaum), Charlie-27 (Ving Rhames), Mainframe (voiced by Miley Cyrus), Krugarr (a CG character), and Aleta (Michelle Yeoh). This group, along with Yondu, all worked together in the past before Yondu’s “betrayal” of the Ravagers. Given that the Guardians comics are no strangers to time travel, it wouldn’t be a stretch for this newly assembled team to go back and save Yondu. But whether they do or not, director James Gunn told IGN that the group shot was more than just a wink at fans and he wants to see these Ravagers/Guardians go on to do their own thing in the MCU.\n\nWhile we’re talking about the Ravagers, given that we saw Sean Gunn’s Kraglin practicing with Yondu’s whistle-arrow and making a pincushion out of Drax, we’re guessing he’ll be the one to take over Yondu’s role as Ravager leader.\n\nHowever, the most important of these end-credits scenes features a direct setup for one of Marvel’s most popular and storied cosmic characters, Adam Warlock. Both Ayesha and Adam have a super complicated backstory, but the gist is they are genetic twins who both went on to become powerful players in Marvel’s space stories. Adam in particular was key to defeating Thanos in the Infinity Gauntlet comic and has strong ties to both the Guardians and the Avengers. He even had an Infinity Gem affixed to his forehead in the comics. But for the MCU, Gunn told IGN that he’ll be sitting out Avengers: Infinity War and will instead be a big character in the future alongside the returning Ayesha, which we’re assuming means they’ll be a brother/sister villain duo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. And in case you were wondering, Gunn said he made a mistake by including Adam’s signature cocoon as an Easter egg in the first Guardians movie (as glimpsed inside the Collector’s museum), which is why we see a new, tech-based cocoon this time around.\n\nNow, this next one wasn’t a post-credits scene, but Nebula flying off to find and kill Thanos is of utmost importance. Avengers: Infinity War will see Thanos finally taking the fight to Earth’s heroes to assemble the all-powerful Infinity Gauntlet, and we already know that the Guardians will be making an appearance in that film, so Nebula will probably be the one who calls them in after she finds Thanos on Earth. If the MCU decides to follow the comics, then Nebula will play a vital role in stopping Thanos because it’s she who winds up being his undoing on the printed page.\n\nSpeaking of Infinity War, we get a funny post-credits scene featuring Peter chastising an angsty teen Groot. While this was mostly played for laughs, it also tells us that Groot is growing like a weed and will most likely be back to his original, adult body size by the time we see him again in Infinity War.\n\nAnd finally, we catch up with Stan Lee talking to the Watchers (we’d also gotten a glimpse of this earlier in the film). They are all-seeing cosmic beings who have a code to observe intelligent life throughout the universe. But while they are adept at watching, listening is another story. Not even they could bear hearing Stan’s exhaustive list of cameos.\n\nThat’s everything Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 gave us to look forward to.

Todoroki's compelling backstory continues to unfold. Todoroki's compelling backstory continues to unfold.\n\nWarning: Full spoilers for the episode below.\n\nFollowing the climactic end of the cavalry battle, My Hero Academia takes a welcome break from all the action in \"The Boy Born with Everything,\" delivering an episode rich with character development and clever humor that provides a nice reprieve before the intense final round of the U.A. Sports Festival.\n\n\"If this were a comic, he'd be the main character. That was the kind of backstory he had.\" These words echo in Deku's mind after learning of Todoroki's troubled past, and perfectly encapsulate just how enthralling and compelling a character Todoroki has become. The conversation between the two is unquestionably my favorite moment of the entire episode, as it not only makes Todoroki more relatable—the story of his mother pouring boiling water on him as a child was particularly heart-wrenching—but also further fleshes out My Hero Academia's fictional world.\n\nTodoroki confronts Deku after the cavalry battle\n\nWe learn that Todoroki's dad, Endeavor, only married his mother because of her Quirk so that he could create a child with both ice and fire abilities. Endeavor has been stuck in All Might's shadow as the second greatest hero and hopes to surpass him through his son's achievements. Until now, it hadn't even occurred to me that marriages might be strategically arranged for the sake of producing children with more powerful Quirks. This fascinating revelation not only develops Todoroki's back story, but also adds a new layer of depth to the world that extends beyond the happenings within U.A. High.\n\nIn an effort to fight against becoming a tool to boost his father's pride, Todoroki has rejected his fiery half, illustrating a father-son dynamic that I found to be extremely relatable. Despite his rebellious efforts, Todoroki is in many ways a direct reflection of Endeavor. Even though it's being done in defiance to his father, Todoroki is determined to surpass Deku, mirroring Endeavor's determination to be greater than All Might. The way in which these two relationships parallel one another is extremely fascinating, as I can't wait to see if Todoroki, like his dad, is destined to live in the shadow of Deku as the world's second greatest hero, and whether or not he becomes a resentful man overtaken by his pride because of it.\n\nAmongst all of this emotionally taxing character development are a few moments of perfectly placed comedy that help lighten the mood. Torodoki probing Deku to find out more about the connection between him and All Might was especially great. The reaction on Deku's face after being asked if he was All Might's love child was hilarious. The antics of Mineta and Kaminari were another comedic highlight, as the two hatch a silly little plan to trick the girls into wearing cheerleader outfits, reminding us just how mischievous yet endearing this pair of goofballs can be.\n\nMineta and Kaminari celebrate their successful effort to trick the girls\n\nThe integrity among the students was another great aspect of \"The Boy Born with Everything.\" This is beautifully conveyed when Ojiro and Shoda come forward to withdraw from the final round of the competition because they don't believe they truly earned their spot among the final sixteen, and further illustrated when Kendo suggests that instead of having members from her team join the final round in their place, it should be two from Team Tetsutetsu because of how hard they fought during the cavalry battle. I am continually impressed by how well My Hero Academia incorporates some of these lesser known characters, fostering an emotional connection with so many U.A. students that are granted such a small amount of screen time.\n\nWhile the recreational games that precede the final round of the U.A. Sports Festival aren't particularly memorable, the stark contrast between these moments of levity and the solitary shots of Deku, Todoroki, Bakugo and several other students who opted to mentally prepare alone before the tournament was incredibly effective. I found myself tensing up with anxiety for each one of the participants who've made it into the final round, as all eyes will be on each of them as they take center stage and face off against one another with the hopes of getting scouted become a pro hero. Thanks to an effective cliffhanger at the very end of the episode, the tension is ratcheted up that much further, as we see Deku fall victim to Shinsou's Quirk during his first match of the tournament. I can't wait to see how Deku handles this predicament as he fights to make it to round two, where he'll face off against Todoroki if they both manage to triumph in round one.","author":"Alex Osborn","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T22:49:38.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/05/06/mha19-1494074629337_1280w.png","class":"Technology","digest":"Ihgvx+Y0TSgeoeCTCeHHdQ==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"590ec43c9e4da44e454652db"},"description":"From Underworld to KOTOR 3 to George Lucas' original sequel trilogy, there's a lot of cancelled Star Wars we wish had been made.","title":"7 Star Wars Projects That Never Saw the Light of Day - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/05/04/7-star-wars-projects-that-never-saw-the-light-of-day","text":"Share. From Underworld to Knights of the Old Republic 3 to George Lucas’ original sequel trilogy, there’s a lot of cancelled Star Wars we wish had been made. From Underworld to Knights of the Old Republic 3 to George Lucas’ original sequel trilogy, there’s a lot of cancelled Star Wars we wish had been made.\n\nMay the 4th be with you! This month will mark the 40th anniversary of the original Star Wars movie, which of course went on to become a massive franchise far beyond anyone’s dreams. After the box office success of A New Hope and the transformation of Star Wars into a cultural phenomenon way back when, George Lucas indicated that he had some very ambitious plans for both a prequel trilogy and a sequel trilogy. Of course, only the prequels emerged as a finished project under his direction, leaving the rest as an unrealized dream until 2015’s The Force Awakens.\n\nHowever, that’s nothing new for the Star Wars franchise. Over the past four decades, many intriguing plans have been laid out for that universe, and some of them barely made it past the development stages. So in honor of May the 4th, we’re looking back at seven of the cancelled Star Wars films, television shows and even video games that deserved -- but never got -- a chance to show us new sides of that galaxy far, far away.\n\nStar Wars: Underworld\n\nA live-action Star Wars TV series was a tantalizing project for the better part of a decade prior to Disney’s purchase of Lucasfilm. George Lucas was so serious about making Star Wars: Underworld that there are reportedly completed scripts for 50 episodes, including significant contributions from Battlestar Galactica’s Ronald D. Moore and Matthew Graham (Life on Mars).\n\nUnderworld would have taken place between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope while shining a light on the darker and more adult aspects of the Star Wars universe. According to several rumors, Underworld would have further explored Coruscant’s criminal network and the continued rise of the Empire with new characters and occasional appearances by previously established fan favorites. With so much material already written, it’s not impossible for this show to make a comeback. However, Lucasfilm’s current focus appears to largely be on the new sequel trilogy and the anthology films. That doesn’t leave much hope for this show, at least at the moment.\n\nStar Wars 1313\n\nStar Wars 1313 was another unfortunate casualty of the Disney buyout, as was LucasArts itself. Much like Star Wars: Underworld, Star Wars 1313 would have been a darker and more adult take on the universe, and it would have also focused on the lower levels frequented by Coruscant’s criminal element.\n\nIt’s not clear how far along 1313 was in development, but a trailer was shown at E3 in 2012 and it was very well received. Just the idea alone is very enticing, and we’d still love to see it happen. But it doesn’t seem likely that Star Wars 1313 will be revived any time soon.\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 3\n\nIn 2003, BioWare’s Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic captured the imaginations of Star Wars fans with its exciting storyline that was set thousands of years before the original movies. A sequel followed in 2004, but the third and final game in the trilogy never materialized. KOTOR 3 was in active development at one point, and it presumably would have dealt with the lingering threads of Revan and the Jedi Exile.\n\nWhile Star Wars: The Old Republic brought Revan back and continued his story, we’d love to once again step into that character’s shoes and chart a new course for the future. There are still rumors that we may eventually see a remake of KOTOR, but nothing has been confirmed and it may simply be a distant dream... for now.\n\nThe Final Episodes of Star Wars: The Clone Wars\n\nAfter Disney purchased Lucasfilm, the company abruptly pulled away from Star Wars: The Clone Wars, its hit animated series on Cartoon Network. That left fans with a shortened 13 episode final season that ultimately ran on Netflix, but it also meant that the show never truly got the series finale that it deserved.\n\nFortunately, some of the lost episodes have been released in different forms, including a Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir comic book as well as the Asajj Ventress \u0026 Quinlan Vos Dark Disciple novel. The animatics were also released for episodes including \"Crystal Crisis\" and \"A Death on Utapau,\" an adventure with Anakin and Obi-Wan. However, The Clone Wars still feels like an unfinished epic. It deserves to get a proper wrap up, even if that story has to be told in a different medium.\n\nStar Wars Detours\n\nUnlike The Clone Wars stories, Lucasfilm seems to be content with letting Star Wars Detours sit on the shelf forever. Back in 2012, Robot Chicken creators Seth Green and Matthew Senreich teamed up with Lucasfilm for Star Wars Detours, a comedy series that would have lined up a few of the stars from the prequel and original trilogy, as well as fan favorites like Felicia Day, Donald Faison, Nat Faxon, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, and Seth MacFarlane.\n\nAccording to Green, 39 episodes of Star Wars Detours were completed before Disney purchased Lucasfilm. At the time, the new regime questioned whether it would be a good idea to dilute the brand with a comedy show before the new trilogy. However, that didn’t stop Lucasfilm from releasing the more comedic LEGO Star Wars specials or LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures.\n\nBecause Star Wars Detours has completed episodes, it is entirely possible that it could still be released. All it requires is the will to do so.\n\nJosh Trank’s Rumored Boba Fett Movie\n\nThere may still be a Boba Fett movie someday, but it won’t be directed by Josh Trank. After the breakout response to his found-footage superpowers film Chronicle, Trank was quickly signed to reboot the Fantastic Four for Fox and was also lined up to direct one of the first Star Wars anthology movies. However, the problems with Fantastic Four played out in a very public way long before the film collapsed at the box office. Trank subsequently left his Star Wars anthology film before its subject was even officially revealed.\n\nLast year, word emerged that Trank’s project would likely have been a Boba Fett solo film, with other iconic bounty hunters also slated to appear. Considering that Fett had an inglorious death in Return of the Jedi, this would have been done largely because the fans have always loved the enigmatic character. We wouldn’t be too shocked if Boba Fett is still the subject of the third Star Wars anthology film, or if he shows up elsewhere soon enough.\n\nGeorge Lucas’ Sequel Trilogy\n\nWhile the ongoing success of Star Wars belongs to many people, it was George Lucas’ vision that gave birth to the franchise. At times, Lucas’ plans for Star Wars have been at odds with fan expectations, but it was ultimately his prerogative to chart out the course of its future. And at different times, there were two very different sequel trilogies in mind for Star Wars.\n\nSome of the original ideas for a sequel trilogy were tossed aside during the making of Return of the Jedi, including the notion that Luke’s sister was a woman who hadn’t been introduced yet. Lucas has dropped a few hints about what he had in mind in interviews from the ’80s, but he was still light on concrete details.\n\nMore recently, Lucas had plans for a very different Star Wars sequel trilogy that would have also brought back the original stars of the franchise. Disney and the new Lucasfilm regime had their own ideas, and Lucas’ concepts were ultimately set aside. However, we’d still love to see what Lucas had in mind for both sequel trilogies, and it’s not impossible.\n\nRemember, Lucas didn’t feel compelled to follow the Expanded Universe, so it’s likely that he had a very different future in mind for Luke, Han, and Leia. Dark Horse Comics previously produced an excellent comic book adaptation of Lucas’ early draft for Star Wars, and Marvel could easily use that as a template to adapt Lucas’ sequel trilogy. That’s assuming that Lucas’ sequels exist as more than just a broad outline. Hopefully we’ll be able to see that someday.\n\nWhat unmade Star Wars concepts do you wish had been realized? Let’s discuss in the comments!","author":"Blair Marnell","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-04T14:05:05.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/05/04/starwarsprojects-1280-1493921186844_1280w.jpg","class":"Sports","digest":"7MdqvyTzpIfjNSAcjC1Y1w==\n"}

We have writer Nick Spencer on-hand to discuss this latest shocking twist.","title":"Captain America's Unbelievable Feat Explained by Secret Empire Writer Nick Spencer - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/05/06/captain-americas-unbelievable-feat-explained-by-secret-empire-writer-nick-spencer","text":"Share. \"We're constantly looking for ways to make the story bigger...\" \"We're constantly looking for ways to make the story bigger...\"\n\nMarvel's huge Secret Empire event has thrown the entire Marvel Universe into disarray. Captain America's betrayal was a huge shocker, resonating far beyond the Marvel Universe and into mainstream pop culture. As unbelievable as that moment was, Cap has shocked readers once again, accomplishing a feat seemingly impossible. Writer Nick Spencer sat down with us to discuss this monumental Marvel occurrence.\n\nSPOILERS FOLLOW! The following interview contains spoilers for the Free Comic Book Day issue of Marvel's Secret Empire. If you haven't yet picked up and read your copy, be advised. The spoilers begin after the video below.\n\nCaptain America has revealed himself as the leader of Hydra, and Marvel's biggest heroes have gathered. The hammer of Thor, Mjolnir, falls to the ground after the Asgardian disappears and Captain America walks over to it and in a huge shocker, lifts the hammer.\n\n\"It's a big moment. It's a big, scary moment for the Marvel Universe,\" writer Nick Spencer told us. \"We wanted an iconic image that would signify to the audience and to everybody in the Marvel Universe that the fight was sort of over before it began.\"\n\n\"We thought 'what's a bigger finish than Hydra Captain Steve getting his hands on that hammer?' It has so much significance and meaning both to the broader Marvel Universe but also to Steve and Steve's own history,\" Spencer explained. \"When he picks that up, it really is your sign that this thing is over before it starts.\"\n\nBut how exactly is Captain America, now the leader of Hydra, able to hoist the mighty hammer? \"It certainly is a plot point we're going to keep coming back to and revisiting and talking about,\" Spencer said. \"We're going to talk a little about what the meaning of 'worthiness' is.\" Spencer said they've worked with Thor writer Jason Aaron \"really closely\" on not just the story in Secret Empire, but \"other ways in which Thor and Asgard will connect\" to the book.\n\n\"Big plans there,\" he said.\n\nBut the question remains, is there any sort of trickery or illusions at work in Cap's unbelievable feat, or is he actually able to lift Mjolnir?\n\n“ \"Oh, he's really lifting it,\" Spencer assured us.\n\n\"Oh, he's really lifting it,\" Spencer assured us. \"People have their theories. There will be a lot of people who refuse to believe it, but sure does look like he really did lift the hammer.\"\n\nThe impetus for Cap's lifting of Thor's hammer comes from wanting \"to bring up the intensity another notch,\" Spencer said. \"When you do something as big as Captain America saying 'Hail Hydra,' that can be a very tough thing to then top the next time around.\"\n\n\"We're constantly looking for ways to make the story bigger, make the story scarier, make it bolder, and this one kind of fell into our laps,\" he explained.\n\n\"Whoever can lift that hammer immediately receives a certain level of reverence and deference within the Marvel Universe. We know that picking up the hammer is a big, big deal, and very very few people can do it. So it's a watershed moment in Cap's whole plan.\"\n\n\"The message that it sends out to everyone across the world is a huge one. It's sort of a credibility building moment for him. He'll always be able to claim whenever people call him evil, or whenever people criticize the things that he's done, he'll be able to say 'I lifted Mjolnir.' So that's another card in his deck now.\"\n\nAs for what the future holds for Secret Empire, Spencer said \"now you're going to see the world under Hydra rule. You're going to see the United States under Hydra rule. So you're going to be introduced to a very new environment.\"\n\nSeth Macy is IGN's weekend web producer and just wants to be your friend.

French voters should unite against her","url":"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721650-emmanuel-macron-will-probably-win-catastrophic-upset-possible-le-pen-has-not-lost-yet","text":"PUNDITS are already looking beyond the French presidential run-off that will take place on May 7th. Emmanuel Macron, the young liberal favourite, is 20 points ahead in the polls. Talk has turned to the obstacles he might face in office. The party he founded, En Marche! (“On the Move!”), will probably not win a majority in the legislature. How, they ask, will he handle the delicate task of coalition-building in a country where old certainties are going up in flames like rum on a banane flambée ?\n\nSteady on. Mr Macron has not won yet. And if voters take it for granted that he will, he might not. Betting on politics is banned in France, but foreign bookmakers give his populist, nationalist opponent, Marine Le Pen, a one-in-six chance of victory—the same odds as Russian roulette. The reason is that Ms Le Pen’s supporters will all turn out in force, so if the other side is apathetic and abstains in large numbers, she could win. French people cannot afford to be complacent about this election, or indifferent to the choices on offer (see article ).\n\nThough his manifesto lacks detail, Mr Macron offers reform, realism and a chance of a more dynamic France. He would loosen the job-killing labour code, trim the gargantuan state a little, reboot Franco-German chumminess and strengthen the institutions that hold the euro zone together.\n\nMs Le Pen, by contrast, offers bigotry mixed with make-believe. Vote for her, she suggests, and the state will shower you with goodies, paid for largely by being less generous to immigrants. She promises earlier retirement, bigger pensions, a short working week, tax cuts and a top-notch hospital on your doorstep. In her belief that French people can prosper by working less and consuming more public services (although government already spends 56% of GDP), she has much in common with Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left candidate who won a fifth of the vote in the first round last month. Her flyers stress this point, hoping to poach his supporters or persuade them to stay at home rather than vote for Mr Macron. Ms Le Pen is also reaching out to mainstream conservatives. To woo followers of François Fillon, a former prime minister who also won a fifth of the vote in the first round, she has borrowed some of his lines about France’s unique place in the universe and downplayed some of her more alarming policies, such as quitting the euro and perhaps the European Union itself.\n\nTo voters of all stripes, she promises protection. Against the possibility of being laid off, if they have jobs. Against foreign competition. Against crime: she would add 40,000 prison beds, put 15,000 more cops on the street and let them shoot first if they feel threatened. Against terrorism: she would close mosques suspected of radicalism and deport foreigners suspected of jihadist ties. And against having unfamiliar neighbours: she would cut net migration from around 65,000 people a year to 10,000. She contrasts her own patriotic platform (“Choose France”) with the rootless cosmopolitanism of her opponent, a former Rothschild banker. Echoing an old barb from President François Hollande, she says that “the enemy of the French people is still the world of finance, but this time he has a name, he has a face, he has a party.”\n\nThis is powerful stuff. Ms Le Pen stirs deeper passions than Mr Macron. And even among voters repelled by her party’s xenophobic baggage, there is an alarming ambivalence. Many far-leftists talk of a choice between “plague and cholera”, and urge abstention. “There is no hierarchy of unacceptability between Le Pen and Macron. Between xenophobia and bowing to banks,” declared Emmanuel Todd, a public intellectual.\n\nVote for the banker. It’s important\n\nIf enough voters swallow such sophistry, Ms Le Pen could prevail. Her promised handouts would not materialise, since France is already perilously indebted and her scheme to print francs again would spark a financial crisis. Her bid to protect French jobs would lead to more unemployment. Her plan to shut out foreign goods and ideas would make France poorer and less productive. But the division that she fosters and exploits will endure, even if she loses. Nearly half of voters in the first round backed anti-EU candidates. French Muslims and non-Muslims are far from reaching a modus vivendi. And Ms Le Pen will be back in 2022. French voters should give Mr Macron a thumping majority, and a mandate to address the malaise that makes his opponent’s demagoguery so popular.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-04T14:54:55.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20170506_LDP001_0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"Kn9yle80nnWAY6PYywzl4w==\n"}

A dozen generals, in full ceremonial uniform, were in the audience. He asked them to stand and be applauded.\n\nIt was a telling moment. Mr Maduro is facing the biggest threat to his rule since he took office in 2013. Four-fifths of the “ pueblo ” he claims to represent want him to stand down. Street protests, provoked by shortages of food and the regime’s thuggery, erupt daily and are sometimes massive. The economy is in such an appalling state, and inflation is so high, that Venezuelans greeted a rise of 60% in the minimum wage on May 1st with shrugs of “so what?” A political shift to the centre-right in several of Venezuela’s neighbours makes Mr Maduro’s “Bolivarian” socialist regime look ever more isolated.\n\nBut, for the president, none of that may matter. His future will be decided by the armed forces, not directly by the people. If they withdraw support from his beleaguered regime, change will come soon. If not, hunger and repression will continue.\n\nSo far, there is little sign of dissent in the top ranks. Vladimir Padrino López, the head of the armed forces and minister of defence, hailed Mr Maduro’s call for a new constitution as “a clear demonstration of democratic will”. With that, he endorsed the latest stage in the president’s progressive dismantling of democracy.\n\nThe constitution Mr Maduro wants to replace is the handiwork of Hugo Chávez, his political mentor, who died in 2013. The 500 members of the constituent assembly that will convene to write it will have almost absolute power while they deliberate. Half will be appointed. The rest will be selected by “people’s committees” similar to communist soviets. The whole process is intended to pre-empt other meaningful political activity. It will distract attention from the regime’s subversion of the existing constitution. It has carried this out by, for example, depriving the opposition-controlled legislature of its rightful powers.\n\nAll eyes turn to the men in green\n\nThe opposition is increasingly directing its appeals to the armed forces, or to factions within them. Julio Borges, the legislature’s president, says it is time for the men in green to “break their silence”. Henrique Capriles, a potential challenger to Mr Maduro who has been banned from seeking office for 15 years, asked ordinary soldiers to consider whether they want to “share the fate” of the doomed ruling party.\n\nThe army is not the regime’s only prop. The National Guard fires tear-gas at and wields truncheons against demonstrators; informal gangs called colectivos enforce submission to the regime in neighbourhoods and are responsible for many of the 33 deaths in protests over the past month. Mr Maduro wants to provide a half-million guns to an expanded “national militia”, a sort of home guard.\n\nBut the armed forces, though constitutionally required to be apolitical, are the final arbiters of power. Chavismo , the movement that guides the regime, has been military-led since its inception. Chávez began his career in politics as a left-wing commander who attempted a coup in 1992 (and won a presidential election six years later). Officers or former officers run 11 of the 32 ministries; 11 of the 23 state governors are retired officers. Mr Maduro has been a prolific producer of generals. On one day last year he promoted 195 officers to that rank, bringing their number to more than 2,000. The United States somehow gets by with no more than 900 generals.\n\nThe Venezuelan top brass are not a monolithic group. There are “diverse” factions, both between and within branches of the armed forces, says Rocío San Miguel, a lawyer and defence specialist. A group of “originals” fought alongside Chávez in 1992. They include Diosdado Cabello, a former president of the legislature and still-influential hardliner. An overlapping clique helps drug-trafficking gangs through its control of ports and airports. A bigger group of non-ideological “opportunists” dabbles in that and other businesses.\n\nThese divisions matter less than the generals’ shared interest in the regime’s survival. Most profit handsomely from Mr Maduro’s chaotic rule. Some have access to dollars at the ridiculously cheap price in bolívares set by the government. The army is in charge of the lucrative business of food distribution, a recipe for abuse.\n\nThe lower ranks are less happy, though they are better housed than most Venezuelans and some profit from sidelines such as smuggling. According to Caracas Chronicles Political Risk Report , a journal with sources in the armed forces, DCI, an agency that snoops on the barracks, has been hearing of “deepening disaffection”, especially in the army’s middle ranks, since February, before the latest protests began. Much of this appears linked “with mid-ranking officers barely bothering to suppress their contempt for a general staff it perceives as corrupt”, it reported. In April three lieutenants posted a video saying they rejected Mr Maduro as commander-in-chief. They sought asylum in Colombia.\n\nRaúl Baduel, a jailed former defence minister, has become an icon for dissenters. They share a 14-second recording in which he says he is in prison because he spurned “the scoundrels and criminals …who give you orders”. Junior soldiers, and their families, share the privations that drive Venezuelans onto the streets in protest. They are angry. But that does not mean that they will stop following orders.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-04T14:54:55.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20170506_AMP001_0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"33N6xgA2EJJBJRqgynKoAA==\n"}

For the species it is the danger of imminent extinction; for wildlife-lovers it is barbarism; for law-enforcers it is failure. For its poachers it means income; the horn will be exported illegally to fetch tens of thousands of dollars. For economists, it means market forces are at work.\n\nSouth Africa is in the throes of a poaching epidemic. Official figures show poachers killed 1,054 rhinos in 2016, up from just 13 in 2007. In Kruger National Park, home to the world’s largest rhino population, numbers are dropping despite a fall in recorded poaching incidents. Tom Milliken of TRAFFIC, a wildlife-trade monitoring network, worries that poachers have become better at hiding the carcasses.\n\nThe problem is international. The rhino-horn supply-chain sprawls from South Africa, home to nearly three-quarters of the world’s rhinos, to Asia, and in particular to Vietnam, where rhino horn is coveted as medicine, prescribed for fevers, alcohol dependency and even cancer.\n\nProhibitionists call for better law-enforcement. Demand for rhino horn in China, they point out, fell sharply after the government banned its use in 1993. In the rhino’s homelands, they say, extra patrols, fences and harsher penalties have helped curb poaching in the past couple of years.\n\nBut some argue the trade ban might actually be making the problem worse. Restricted supply pushes up prices and pulls in poachers. Private rhino-ranchers argue that if they could sell their stocks of horn, they could undercut the illegal trade. Some already chop off their rhinos’ horns to make them worthless to poachers. Unlike elephant ivory, rhino horn grows back after a few years. Michael Knight, who chairs a specialist group on rhinos at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, an NGO, worries that, if rhino-horn sales remain illegal, ranchers will switch to cattle. They bear the cost of security. Poachers make the money.\n\nBut by seeming to normalise rhino-horn use, legalisation might boost demand along with supply. Prohibitionists worry that any attempt to lower prices would both bring in more customers, leaving incentives to poach unchanged, and make it far easier to launder illegal, poached horn.\n\nFor them, the best form of conservation is to cut demand. A new study, requested by the Vietnamese and South African governments and overseen by the International Trade Centre, an independent arm of the WTO and the UN, provides information on where that demand comes from. Thanks to contacts in the traditional-medicine business, the academic researchers who conducted the study interviewed rhino-horn users. Disproportionately, these were well-off older men. None used it as an aphrodisiac. And nothing suggested any stigma in using it: if anything, illegality enhanced the product’s exclusivity and hence their willingness to pay. Asked how their demand would respond to price, users confirmed that cheaper horn would increase usage.\n\nBut if legalisation is risky, so is maintaining the ban. The study finds a hard-core user base of around 30% of rhino-horn users, who want the stuff regardless of the penalties. So long as doctors prescribe it demand will be difficult to eradicate. Douglas MacMillan, an author of the study, is sceptical that information campaigns persuade many people to shun it. Vietnam has already seen vigorous initiatives pointing out that rhino horn is the chemical equivalent of human hair and toenails.\n\nChanges in the law may yield more evidence. On March 30th South Africa’s constitutional court overturned the ban on domestic trade. Now, if they have the right permit, people can trade rhino horn, but not export it. TRAFFIC’s Mr Milliken worries that this will lead to the worst of all worlds. Allowing some legal trade while the authorities are not properly enforcing the ban on illegal trade will muddy already murky waters. Once out of the country, legal and illegal horn will be all but indistinguishable. So users in Vietnam will have cheaper supplies; the illegal dealers still in control of the export trade will pocket the profits; and rhinos will keep falling to the poachers’ bullets.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-04T14:54:55.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20170506_FNP002_0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"15SDsNRQ8K5977Rs3nH3Dg==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"590ec4409e4da44e454652ed"},"description":"The data economy demands a new approach to antitrust rules","title":"The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data","url":"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource","text":"A NEW commodity spawns a lucrative, fast-growing industry, prompting antitrust regulators to step in to restrain those who control its flow. A century ago, the resource in question was oil. Now similar concerns are being raised by the giants that deal in data, the oil of the digital era. These titans—Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—look unstoppable. They are the five most valuable listed firms in the world. Their profits are surging: they collectively racked up over $25bn in net profit in the first quarter of 2017. Amazon captures half of all dollars spent online in America. Google and Facebook accounted for almost all the revenue growth in digital advertising in America last year.\n\nSuch dominance has prompted calls for the tech giants to be broken up, as Standard Oil was in the early 20th century. This newspaper has argued against such drastic action in the past. Size alone is not a crime. The giants’ success has benefited consumers. Few want to live without Google’s search engine, Amazon’s one-day delivery or Facebook’s newsfeed. Nor do these firms raise the alarm when standard antitrust tests are applied. Far from gouging consumers, many of their services are free (users pay, in effect, by handing over yet more data). Take account of offline rivals, and their market shares look less worrying. And the emergence of upstarts like Snapchat suggests that new entrants can still make waves.\n\nBut there is cause for concern. Internet companies’ control of data gives them enormous power. Old ways of thinking about competition, devised in the era of oil, look outdated in what has come to be called the “data economy” (see Briefing ). A new approach is needed.\n\nQuantity has a quality all its own\n\nWhat has changed? Smartphones and the internet have made data abundant, ubiquitous and far more valuable. Whether you are going for a run, watching TV or even just sitting in traffic, virtually every activity creates a digital trace—more raw material for the data distilleries. As devices from watches to cars connect to the internet, the volume is increasing: some estimate that a self-driving car will generate 100 gigabytes per second. Meanwhile, artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning extract more value from data. Algorithms can predict when a customer is ready to buy, a jet-engine needs servicing or a person is at risk of a disease. Industrial giants such as GE and Siemens now sell themselves as data firms.\n\nThis abundance of data changes the nature of competition. Technology giants have always benefited from network effects: the more users Facebook signs up, the more attractive signing up becomes for others. With data there are extra network effects. By collecting more data, a firm has more scope to improve its products, which attracts more users, generating even more data, and so on. The more data Tesla gathers from its self-driving cars, the better it can make them at driving themselves—part of the reason the firm, which sold only 25,000 cars in the first quarter, is now worth more than GM, which sold 2.3m. Vast pools of data can thus act as protective moats.\n\nAccess to data also protects companies from rivals in another way. The case for being sanguine about competition in the tech industry rests on the potential for incumbents to be blindsided by a startup in a garage or an unexpected technological shift. But both are less likely in the data age. The giants’ surveillance systems span the entire economy: Google can see what people search for, Facebook what they share, Amazon what they buy. They own app stores and operating systems, and rent out computing power to startups. They have a “God’s eye view” of activities in their own markets and beyond. They can see when a new product or service gains traction, allowing them to copy it or simply buy the upstart before it becomes too great a threat. Many think Facebook’s $22bn purchase in 2014 of WhatsApp, a messaging app with fewer than 60 employees, falls into this category of “shoot-out acquisitions” that eliminate potential rivals. By providing barriers to entry and early-warning systems, data can stifle competition.\n\nWho ya gonna call, trustbusters?\n\nThe nature of data makes the antitrust remedies of the past less useful. Breaking up a firm like Google into five Googlets would not stop network effects from reasserting themselves: in time, one of them would become dominant again. A radical rethink is required—and as the outlines of a new approach start to become apparent, two ideas stand out.\n\nThe first is that antitrust authorities need to move from the industrial era into the 21st century. When considering a merger, for example, they have traditionally used size to determine when to intervene. They now need to take into account the extent of firms’ data assets when assessing the impact of deals. The purchase price could also be a signal that an incumbent is buying a nascent threat. On these measures, Facebook’s willingness to pay so much for WhatsApp, which had no revenue to speak of, would have raised red flags. Trustbusters must also become more data-savvy in their analysis of market dynamics, for example by using simulations to hunt for algorithms colluding over prices or to determine how best to promote competition (see Free exchange ).\n\nThe second principle is to loosen the grip that providers of online services have over data and give more control to those who supply them. More transparency would help: companies could be forced to reveal to consumers what information they hold and how much money they make from it. Governments could encourage the emergence of new services by opening up more of their own data vaults or managing crucial parts of the data economy as public infrastructure, as India does with its digital-identity system, Aadhaar. They could also mandate the sharing of certain kinds of data, with users’ consent—an approach Europe is taking in financial services by requiring banks to make customers’ data accessible to third parties.\n\nRebooting antitrust for the information age will not be easy. It will entail new risks: more data sharing, for instance, could threaten privacy. But if governments don’t want a data economy dominated by a few giants, they will need to act soon.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T00:00:00.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20170506_LDD001_0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"eF63s5sw+yV0qxNwQf87qw==\n"}

That was the question posed by a group of biologists led by Peter Lindsey of the University of Pretoria, in South Africa. Their conclusions, just published in Global Ecology and Conservation and summarised in the map below, suggest one determinant is the economic value of wildlife to a country, with nature-tourism destinations in east, central and southern Africa, led by Botswana, dominating the list of high performers.\n\nThe team looked at megafauna, defined as terrestrial mammals weighing 15kg or more as adults, if carnivores, or 100kg or more, if herbivores or omnivores. For each of 152 countries examined, they constructed a megafauna-conservation index composed of three elements. The first was, for every relevant species, the fraction of the country it inhabited. The second was the percentage of megafauna habitat which had legal protection. The third was the percentage of GDP a country devoted to conservation.\n\nBesides the safari belt, America, Canada and Scandinavia, excluding Denmark, scored well (though, as the researchers note, “the financial contribution to predator conservation in Norway probably includes funds aimed at keeping predator population as low as possible, which hardly qualifies as conservation”).

Here’s why it matters","title":"On the “hipster election” in Schleswig-Holstein","url":"http://www.economist.com/blogs/kaffeeklatsch/2017/05/between-coasts","text":"ON SUNDAY France goes to the polls. Emmanuel Macron will win and the far-right Front National will do better than in any presidential election to date. So all eyes will be on Paris. Yet far to the north another, less predictable and vastly less reported-on vote will be taking place. One that Pepijn Bergsen, my colleague at the Economist Intelligence Unit, calls the “hipster” election of this weekend. It matters, but few people are paying attention to it.\n\nUnlike the French election the result in Schleswig-Holstein hangs in the balance. No-one knows whether the incumbent Thorsten Albig (of the centre-left SPD) or his challenger Daniel Günther (of the centre-right CDU) will be prime minister of the state for the next four years.\n\nSchleswig-Holstein has been a nest of political turmoil for decades. In 1987 its CDU prime minister was accused of authorising black-ops against his SPD opponent, resigned in disgrace and was subsequently found dead in a bathtub in Geneva in mysterious circumstances. In 2005 the SPD lost control of the state due to a phantom MP. The party and its coalition partners had a majority of one in the Kiel parliament but one never-identified representative kept voting against his or her own party. The coalition collapsed and the CDU took over. Dark rumours still swirl about the identity and motive of the culprit.\n\nPolitics in Schleswig-Holstein today is less dramatic. The small, craggily coastal state at the northern tip of Germany is now calm, stable and, according to one study, happier than any other in the country. Yet once more it is making waves. For a long time it has seemed likely that its governing coalition of SPD, Greens and the South-Schleswig Voters’ Association (the SSW, a tiny party representing the state’s Danish minority) would be reelected. Yet with just 24 hours to go until the election, the last four polls have all put the the CDU ahead of the SPD and implied that the government, known as the “Gambia coalition” for its red-green-blue colours, may lose its majority. All three parties have lost support in the past months, though thanks to the Bonn-Copenhagen Agreement of 1955 the SSW is exempt from the 5% hurdle other German parties must clear to secure representation.\n\nWhy? There are some local factors at play. Voters complain about run-down schools, slow improvements to the autobahn network and patchy rural internet connections. At 6.1%, unemployment in the state is slightly above the national average. Though little known, the angular Mr Günther has run a glitzy campaign—all well-lit, American-style town hall events and slick backdrops—and outperformed Mr Albig in television debates.\n\nYet the vote is hardly devoid of national significance. Mr Schulz has campaigned extensively here, recalling how he met his wife in Husum, a pretty shipping town near the Danish border. Mrs Merkel and her lieutenants have also charged up to the state, materialising in quiet fishing villages and old Hanseatic towns for weeks now.\n\nSchleswig-Holstein is a sparkly prize. Mr Schulz needs his party to win there to prove that the SPD’s poll surge since January, which has fallen back in recent weeks, is not yet dead. During her 12 years as chancellor Mrs Merkel has presided over an embarrassingly long list of CDU disappointments at state elections. So she would draw reassurance and validation from a victory by Mr Günther and the emergence in Schleswig-Holstein of a “Jamaica coalition” (of the CDU, Greens and the liberal FDP).\n\nThe election’s timing makes it especially significant. It comes one week before North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, goes to the polls in another close vote (see my article in this week's The Economist ). And apart from that it is the last popular vote before the general election on September 24th. Should the SPD lose power at this sensitive stage, some in the party may start to panic. Mr Schulz may have tough questions to answer. He may even face a crisis. Meanwhile Mrs Merkel, whose preeminence in the CDU wobbled at the peak of Mr Schulz’s honeymoon a couple of months ago, will be newly secure. The chancellor will go into the general election reinforced and with excellent prospects of keeping her job. So pay attention to what happens between Germany’s North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts on Sunday. Any earthquake there will ripple out, in all directions.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T18:55:42.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20170506_BLP524.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"/wIrOB7CMAsH9A5cF8UiIQ==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"590ec4429e4da44e454652f7"},"description":"His victory is the surest sign yet of a Tory landslide on June 8th","title":"The Conservatives’ Andy Street wins the West Midlands","url":"http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21721805-his-victory-surest-sign-yet-tory-landslide-june-8th-conservatives-andy-street","text":"WITH Andy Street’s victory in the contest to become mayor of the West Midlands, a merely disastrous day for the Labour Party turned into a calamitous one. The West Midlands is natural Labour territory. Labour has 21 of the 28 MPs in the metropolitan area, including the party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson. Six of the seven councils are Labour controlled and in Sandwell 72 out of 72 councillors are Labour. The Labour Party has a large army of foot soldiers who turn out for all these MPs and councillors. It also has an army of loyal supporters in Birmingham’s huge Muslim population: people who originally came from Kashmir, Bangladesh and Pakistan and who vote as a block, and in large numbers, under the watchful eye of local community leaders.\n\nThe victory of Mr Street, the Conservative candidate, was not a knockout: he did not get the required 50% share of the vote to win on the first round and, when second preferences were taken into account, only won by 4,000 votes out of more than half a million cast. The Labour Party also points to other extenuating circumstances. Sion Simon, the Labour candidate, ran a low-profile campaign. Mr Street is a successful businessman, the former managing director of John Lewis, rather than a Tory politician. He is known locally for giving the go-ahead to the construction of a huge John Lewis store in Birmingham’s New Street station. He spent more than $1m on the election campaign before spending limits came into effect. The Conservative Party also devoted significant resources to the race, sending a succession of cabinet members, including Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Chris Grayling, to campaign with Mr Street.\n\nStill, the Labour Party’s loss of such a chunk of home turf suggests a Tory landslide in the making. The prime minister’s battle plan is to expand the Tories’ support deep into Labour territory: just as David Cameron won back middle-class voters who had defected to New Labour, Mrs May wants to win over working-class voters who feel that they have been taken for granted by Labour and are looking for a change. Two groups are particularly important: “just-about-managing” voters who are angry with the status quo, and aspirational ethnic voters, particularly Sikhs and Hindus, who are outgrowing the Labour Party. The Tories calculate that three things can shake these people free from their already weakened loyalties: the vote to leave the European Union in the referendum, Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-edged leftism and Theresa May’s down-to-earth style. The feeling in Conservative Central Office is that Mrs May can appeal to parts of Britain that the silver-spoon-in-the-mouth David Cameron never could.\n\nMr Street’s victory is not proof positive that this strategy is working. The overall turnout was low, at less than 30%. His victory depended in part on the fact that turnout was much higher in Tory areas, such as Dudley and Solihull, than in Labour areas, such as Wolverhampton and Sandwell. Labour Party voters were turned off by Mr Corbyn rather than turned on by Mrs May. But taken with the other Tory victories across the country, it suggests that a re-alignment may be beginning, which could gather pace as campaigning intensifies.\n\nThe mayor’s race is more than just a dress rehearsal for the general election: it matters in its own right. Mr Street’s victory will introduce a valuable element of competition to an area that has suffered from one-party rule for too long. Mr Street’s victory will also increase the chances that Britain’s experiment with local mayors will truly take root. Had Labour won the West Midlands as well as Manchester, where Andy Burnham is the new mayor, Mrs May might have been tempted to do away with an idea that is associated with her predecessor, David Cameron, and his chancellor, George Osborne.

It came in the form of a long-awaited executive order “promoting free speech and religious liberty”. Its content, however, turned out to be rather feeble. One disappointed commentator called it “woefully inadequate”; a noted religious scholar dismissed it as “meaningless” and a “betrayal”. On the other end of the ideological spectrum, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has fought the new president’s moves against sanctuary cities and travel from Muslim countries, couldn’t quite believe its eyes: “We thought we'd have to sue Trump today”, the ACLU tweeted. “But it turned out the order signing was an elaborate photo-op with no discernible policy outcome.”\n\nWhat did everyone expect Mr Trump to do? On February 1st, someone leaked what seemed to be the initial plan to The Nation: a controversial move to allow religious people to exempt themselves from duties impinging on their religious beliefs. Federal workers and contractors who find homosexuality beyond the moral pale would have been able, for example, to ignore a same-sex couple’s marriage licence and reject its tax return or a gay man’s application for veteran’s benefits. Religious organisations would have enjoyed similar immunity—turning away transgender people from soup kitchens or refusing to work with lesbian couples who wished to adopt a child.\n\nOn May 3rd, White House officials confirmed to Politico that this broad licence to discriminate against gays and lesbians was the heart of a potential presidential order. But later that evening, the administration backpedalled vigorously. Without mentioning a radical expansion of the freedom of conscience whereby religious beliefs could be wielded against sexual minorities, the White House lowered expectations. The order would merely direct the Internal Revenue Service to “exercise maximum enforcement discretion to alleviate the burden of the Johnson amendment”, a 1954 rule making churches’ and other non-profit groups’ tax-exempt status contingent on steering clear of certain types of political advocacy.\n\nHaving pledged to “get rid of and totally destroy” the Johnson amendment in early February, in a speech in the White House's Rose Garden on the morning of May 4th, Mr Trump signalled he would do just that. “For too long the federal government has used the power of the state as a weapon against people of faith”, he said, “bullying and even punishing Americans for following their religious beliefs”. With the benefit of his new executive action, he told assembled clergy, “you’re now in a position to say what you want to say” with no federal official “censoring sermons or targeting ­pastors”.\n\nBut when the text of the order emerged in the early afternoon, Mr Trump’s promise seemed to go unfulfilled. In fact, the language of the executive order amounted to a convoluted restatement—rather than repudiation—of the Johnson amendment itself. After a throat-clearing initial section—indicating that the White House will “vigorously enforce federal law's robust protections for religious freedom”—the order got down to business, and the lawyers’ pen came out. Section 2 instructs the IRS “not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship or other religious organisation on the basis that such individual or organisation speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective”. That sounds like something, but it isn’t, really. Listen to the buried caveat in the rest of the sentence: “...where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office”.\n\nHere is the translation: religious leaders speaking from the pulpit have nothing to fear from the IRS if they speak about political issues unless they specifically endorse or oppose particular political candidates. Like all non-profit organisations with tax-exempt status, religious entities aren’t allowed to speak well or ill of individuals running for office. But the Johnson amendment precludes only this kind of talk; it does not bar preachers from holding forth on moral issues of the day. That has been the rule for decades. Mr Trump’s executive order merely repeats it.\n\nIf anything, the new executive order highlights a constraint on churches that the IRS has been loth to apply over the years. For nearly a decade, annual taunts from congregations have been hand-delivered to the IRS in the form of video evidence they are breaking the rule against candidate-advocacy. But the IRS has remained stoically impassive as the gadflies have tried to spur them to attack, prudently avoiding a fight that would give churches an excuse to cry discrimination. So even the mild limit on pulpit advocacy in the Johnson amendment has gone all-but-unenforced over the years, making Mr Trump’s order something decidedly less exciting than weak tea.\n\nOne wonders how the latest and lamest Trump executive order came into being. One possibility is that the original leaked order was the handiwork of Mike Pence, the pious vice president, and that Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, prevailed on him to steer clear of a move that would infuriate the gay and lesbian community and gay-friendly millennials. Another is that lawyers in the Department of Justice are growing weary of defending indefensible orders in the federal courts and then losing, badly. If nothing else, the religious-liberty order is one that should avoid any serious legal challenges. That’s about the best that can be said for it.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T19:26:34.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20170506_USP505.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"nFJYi3e+NgGIU31+aD5bzg==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"590ec4449e4da44e454652fd"},"description":"And “ordinary working families” have little to look forward to","title":"The British economy is not as strong as many think","url":"http://www.economist.com/blogs/speakerscorner/2017/05/how-strong-strong","text":"IT IS NOW a cliché of the campaign that Theresa May is fond of clichés. One such cliché is that Britain has a strong economy. At last week’s prime minister’s questions, for instance, she referred to “a strong economy with the benefits felt by everyone across the country”.\n\nOn one level, this claim seems completely accurate. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Britain was the fastest-growing G7 economy. Many expect growth to slow in 2017, but not by too much. GDP per head is now well above pre-crisis levels. Unemployment is below 5%. The employment rate is its highest since records began.\n\nOn this evidence, the Conservatives would have a claim to be the party of a strong economy. But that is not the whole story. For one, what really matters for many people is not the rate of GDP growth—GDP is a highly abstract concept—but the rate at which their pay-packets are growing. On this question, the Tories have much less to crow about.\n\nCompared with their level in 2010, when the Conservatives came to power along the Lib Dems, inflation-adjusted wages have fallen by about 1%. (They are also still below their pre-crisis level.) That is not a particularly impressive record over seven years, given that Britain was coming out of recession just as the Tories took the reins of power. Some evidence suggests that of advanced economies, since the crisis British wages have done worse only than Greece’s.\n\nThings look particularly bad for the so-called “ordinary working families” that Mrs May is courting assiduously. The number of families in “absolute” poverty (ie, with income less than 60% of the national median in 2010-11, in constant prices) has been drifting upwards. The number of people in working-poor households has grown by around 1m since 2010, having fallen sharply in the late 1990s and 2000s. And now, a majority of the households in poverty are in work (as opposed to lazing on benefits).\n\nThe future does not look particularly bright, either. Average wages are not expected to surpass their pre-crisis level for some time—possibly, until the next general election in 2022.\n\nAnd ordinary working families are probably going to struggle. Assuming that Mrs May does not significantly change tack following the election, a raft of changes to tax and benefits are expected to hit those at the bottom hard (see chart).\n\nA household in the third-bottom income decile, who surely fall into Mrs May’s definition of “ordinary working families”, will see their net income fall by around 5% as a result of tax-and-benefit changes implemented since 2015. There has been a cash freeze in most working-age benefits (which means that as inflation rises, what those benefits can buy goes down and down). The total amount that a household can get in benefits—the so-called “benefit cap”—has been tightened recently.\n\nAll this should give Mrs May pause for thought. The headlines certainly suggest that the British economy is strong. But dig a little deeper, and things look a lot less rosy—especially for her core constituency.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T14:10:26.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20170506_BRP513.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"+2+12lPzQrcrDrgx6sDFiw==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"590ec4449e4da44e45465300"},"description":"“Fantasy Life: Baseball and the American Dream” looks at athletes’ lives on and off the baseball field","title":"Striking out on the American dream","url":"http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2017/05/pitcher-frames","text":"MARK KIGER beat the odds to enjoy a brief moment of sporting success. Only 10% of the thousands of players in Minor League Baseball go on to play at least one game in the Majors, and he made it that far. Selected by Oakland Athletics in the draft in 2002, he went on to play in the MLB during the first round of the playoffs in 2006. But he would leave baseball due to an injury: after that, things started to unravel.\n\nTabitha Soren, an artist and former reporter, became curious about the men who dreamed of becoming professional baseball players and what happened to those dreams (Michael Lewis, Ms Soren’s husband, had introduced her to the draft picks while he was writing “Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game”). She photographed Mr Kiger along with 21 other baseball players who were part of the 2002 Oakland A’s draft class over the course of 15 years, charting the realities of trying to make it as an athlete. Compiled in a new book—which also includes essays penned by some of the players as well as short stories by Dave Eggers—Ms Soren states that her photographs capture “a psychological state of striving and what it looks like to try to touch greatness”. She shows them as they stretch while warming up, as they slide to safety while reaching a base, and as fans crowd around to take photos. There are plenty of the highs and adrenaline that sport provides.\n\nBut the book is most effective in exploring the second acts of sporting careers. Jeremy Brown goes from five seasons in the minors and one in the majors to coal mining, before returning to baseball as a coach. Joe Blanton retired from the game and bought a vineyard in the Napa Valley, returning to the pros as a relief pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers (a neighbour got him back into the game: he needed somebody to play catch with). Nick Swisher ends up playing for the New York Yankees in the World Series-winning team of 2009; in 2010, he becomes an All-Star.\n\nThrough her lens, we see the passion and the disappointment that always accompanies sporting ambition; the images are most powerful when showing those who did not attain great stardom or immortality. On the opening page, Steve Stanley, a former outfielder for the Oakland A’s, is pictured swinging a bat; we are informed that he now works as an insurance agent. Steve Obenchain—who pitched in the minor leagues for five seasons—is shown teaching his young son (he was forced to retire due to an arm injury). He now works as a supervisor of portfolio support services at Donaldson Capital Management in Evansville, Indiana.\n\nThe toll of dreams thwarted is tangible: Mr Kiger is pictured first as a fresh, young, Oakland A’s player, bright in his green and gold uniform during his first spring training in 2003. This is powerfully juxtaposed with a portrait taken a decade later, where Mr Kiger sports the same pose but a white ribbed tank top instead of his uniform and a clutch of tattoos on his arms. “One of the managers said that he was his favourite type of player because he had nothing to lose,” explained Ms Soren. “He was going to make this, or he was not going to be able to make anything.” After his “nightmare period”—enduring the death of his parents, a divorce, homelessness, depression and substance abuse—Mr Kiger is back on his feet, working as a little league travel ball coach.\n\nMs Soren can relate to the players’ desire to achieve a quintessential American dream; she says that the images speak to a tendency to believe that you have not led a “meaningful life unless you’ve been number one, or you’ve been the exception to the rule”. This brings Olympian achievement to a few, but psychological burdens to many. “It certainly made me work hard,” said Ms Soren, referring to the high bar set by the notion of the “American dream”. “I don’t know if happiness comes along with that that easily.”","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-04T17:54:41.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20170506_BKP508.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"MXdt3cU34PHKEDiTXlhyfw==\n"}

Bloomberg News … of SHOW CAPTION HIDE CAPTION of\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B 0.13% is already examining ways to benefit from the lower corporate tax rate proposed by President Donald Trump, Chairman Warren Buffett said at the company’s annual meeting Saturday.\n\nThe company had a “slight preference” for taking a tax loss on some of its investments in the first quarter, Mr. Buffett said, because it expects that such a loss would be less valuable to Berkshire in the future if taxes are lower. Berkshire said Friday that its first-quarter net earnings fell 27%, hurt by weaker investment gains.\n\nThe Trump administration unveiled a plan last month to lower taxes on all businesses to 15%. Most of Berkshire’s revenue comes from the U.S., so it would expect a large benefit from lower taxes.\n\nSome of those benefits would be passed along to the company’s customers, especially in its heavily regulated utility businesses and in the more-competitive industries in which it operates, Mr. Buffett said. But shareholders would benefit too, especially due to lower taxes on Berkshire’s investment gains.\n\nMr. Buffett, a longtime Democrat, supported Hillary Clinton in the presidential campaign. But he has said Berkshire’s long-term performance won’t depend on who is president.\n\nMr. Buffett and Berkshire’s vice chairman, Charles Munger, answered questions from shareholders, analysts and journalists for hours on Saturday in Omaha, Neb. Tens of thousands of Berkshire fans traveled from around the world to hear Messrs. Buffett and Munger speak and to shop at Berkshire businesses, including See’s Candies, Fruit of the Loom and Dairy Queen.\n\nThe enthusiastic crowd, many of whom stood outside for hours to get prime seats inside the arena, responded to Messrs. Buffett and Munger’s familiar stories and jokes with laughter and applause.\n\nThe two men touched on everything from the effect of accounting policies on Berkshire’s balance sheet to their regret at not investing in Amazon.com Inc. or Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\nThe company’s shareholders voted to re-elect the board of directors and rejected three shareholder resolutions. The proposed resolutions asked for more disclosure on Berkshire’s political contributions and methane emissions and for divestment from oil- and gas-related businesses.\n\nAlso at Saturday’s meeting, Mr. Buffett suggested that his successor as Berkshire’s chief executive could take over while Mr. Buffett is still alive, and that his successor’s chief responsibility will be spending Berkshire’s cash.\n\nIn a key development for shareholders Saturday, Mr. Buffett suggested that Berkshire could pay a dividend in the next few years, an acknowledgment that the company’s cash pile is growing faster than he can spend it. Berkshire said Friday that it held $96.5 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, up from $86 billion at year-end.\n\nBerkshire and Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital made a $143 billion approach to take over Unilever UL -0.14% PLC in February, but Unilever declined.\n\nMr. Buffett revealed Saturday that Berkshire and 3G were each going to pitch in $15 billion to help Kraft Heinz buy Unilever. Each company owns about a quarter of Kraft Heinz. But Berkshire’s participation was contingent on the deal being a friendly offer, Mr. Buffett said.\n\nMr. Buffett defended 3G for another year as he faced questions about how its penchant for cutting costs and laying off employees aligns with Berkshire’s values. Mr. Buffett said 3G makes necessary cuts for its businesses.\n\nConcerning Wells Fargo \u0026 Co.’s 2016 sales-tactic scandal, Mr. Buffett blamed former Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf for failing to respond immediately to the problem.\n\n“The moment the CEO heard about it he had to act. He didn’t,” said Mr. Buffett.\n\nBerkshire is Wells Fargo’s biggest shareholder and didn’t sell any of its shares after the scandal. Berkshire sold some Wells Fargo shares this year to keep its ownership under 10% but said its investment view on the bank hadn’t changed.\n\nWells Fargo had a bad incentive system, Mr. Buffett said, and the bank’s executives should have responded to reports of wrongdoing earlier. Mr. Buffett made similar comments last year.\n\n“We agree with Mr. Buffett’s comments and value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer,” said a spokesman for Wells Fargo. “We have taken decisive actions to fix the problems, make things right for customers, and build a better Wells Fargo.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported that new Wells Fargo Chief Executive Timothy Sloan told some employees in November that the bank found “some instances” where reports by employees of bad behavior to its ethics line weren’t handled appropriately.\n\nThough Berkshire’s dozens of companies operate independently, its strong culture and managers help minimize problems, Mr. Buffett said.\n\n“You will have better results that way, in terms of behavior, than if you have a 1,000-page guidebook,” he said.\n\nHe noted Berkshire has a hotline for employees to call to report misbehavior that gets about 4,000 calls a year. Employees have also sent anonymous letters to Mr. Buffett directly, he said.\n\nWhile many calls are frivolous, the hotline has repeatedly caught behavior that Mr. Buffett stepped in to stop. And three or four anonymous letters “have resulted in major changes” at a subsidiary over the past several years, Mr. Buffett said.\n\nMr. Buffett also admitted a mistake of his own. “I was wrong” on Berkshire’s investment in International Business Machines Corp. in 2011, he said. Mr. Buffett told CNBC on Thursday that Berkshire has sold about one-third of its IBM stake, as the business didn’t perform as well as Berkshire expected due to strong competition.\n\nMr. Buffett also said that autonomous vehicles pose a threat to Berkshire’s BNSF Railway and its Geico car-insurance business, but he wasn’t too concerned. “My personal view is that they will certainly come,” he said, but “I think they may be a long way off.”\n\nIn one political area, Mr. Buffett was critical, noting concerns about the proposed Republican tax plan.\n\n“My federal income taxes would have gone down 17%” last year based on the bill that just passed the House of Representatives, he said. “It was a huge tax cut for guys like me.”\n\nOn health care, he provided both political and more general economic concerns, with both Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger saying that health-care costs had gotten out of control.\n\n“Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness,” said Mr. Buffett.\n\nWrite to Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.com and Erik Holm at erik.holm@wsj.com","author":"Nicole Friedman","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T17:00:00.000Z"},"source":"the-wall-street-journal","urlToImage":"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-TI119_33Anb_TOP_20170506124947.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"9cAT4pY5pmUYebZLbXR0yA==\n"}

Photo: Reuters\n\nNike Inc.’s NKE -0.95% attempt to stage the first sub-two-hour marathon fell just short Saturday, a rare marketing miss for the world’s largest sportswear maker.\n\nEliud Kipchoge, the reigning Olympic marathon champion, finished the company-controlled race in two hours, 25 seconds—more than two minutes better than the current world best. Still, his mark likely won’t be ratified as a world record, since Nike didn’t obey regulations on pacing and hydrating in its race. Two other runners, Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia and Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea, fell out of contention early and finished several minutes behind.\n\nNike invested years of research and had more than a dozen employees working on the project, dubbed Breaking 2, a multifaceted effort to engineer technically sophisticated footwear and prepare the three elite distance runners to break an iconic time barrier in sports. The race was staged on a Formula One racetrack in Monza, Italy, selected for its ideal climate for distance running, and Nike flew in dozens of other world-class runners to set the pace for the contestants.\n\nUltimately, the Breaking 2 race amounted to a two-hour live-stream program by Nike that was part commercial, part sporting event, and part foray into broadcasting with celebrity commentary. The race was shown across several social media platforms including Twitter , Facebook , and YouTube.\n\nNike didn’t respond to questions regarding whether it will continue the project. In a statement, Chief Executive Mark Parker, who attended the marathon, said “this achievement represents more than a race. It’s a moment of global inspiration that will encourage every athlete, in every community, to push the limits of their potential.”\n\nIn the months before the event, Nike said it wouldn’t consider it a failure if the runners didn’t break two hours. Still, not meeting the ambitious time goal may thwart the company’s plans to sell $250 carbon-plate running shoes—modeled after those worn Saturday by the pros—to the general public.\n\nBreaking the two-hour marathon has become something of an arms race among top sportswear companies, with rival Adidas AG working on a similar project. The German company sponsors the current world record holder, Dennis Kimetto of Kenya, who ran 2:02:57 in 2014. Running under two hours would require a 2.4% improvement over Mr. Kimetto’s record, a wide margin for a sport which typically sees world records broken by much smaller percentages.\n\nNike is the world’s largest sports brand by revenue, though it has been struggling with sales in North America, its home market, amid a changing retail environment and a shift away from technical shoes toward more casual sneakers. That shift has favored Adidas, which this week reported a 31% jump in sales in the region for its most recent period.\n\nNike spends more than $3 billion each year on so-called demand creation expenses, which includes marketing and endorsement costs. In an interview with Runner’s World published this week, Mr. Parker wouldn’t quantify how much the company spent on the marathon race, saying it was expensive but “it’s not like we’re reckless sailors.”\n\nIt isn’t clear what is next for the three runners, who skipped the lucrative spring marathon season to focus on the Nike race. Jos Hermens, an agent representing Mr. Kipchoge, said in an interview last week that anything slower than the current world record “would be a failure.”\n\nIt is the third time Mr. Kipchoge has fallen short when chasing a time goal, including at the Berlin Marathon in 2015 when the insoles of his Nike shoes fell apart and caused him to miss the world record by 63 seconds.\n\nWrite to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com","author":"Sara Germano","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T07:28:00.000Z"},"source":"the-wall-street-journal","urlToImage":"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-TI098_33zeE_TOP_20170506041557.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"1uu7ff2rCB1VtEmJn/nPng==\n"}

Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), left, at the White House in March. Their fragile alliance is at the fore in the effort to pass a health-care bill. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump’s administration was still in its first hours when Mitch McConnell snagged an open seat next to him for a private chat at his inaugural luncheon. For more than 15 minutes, McConnell did most of the talking. The new president listened keenly.\n\nEleven days later, McConnell had a front-row seat as Trump announced Neil M. Gorsuch as his pick for the Supreme Court, the culmination of the Senate majority leader’s advice during the campaign on how to handle the court vacancy: Consult the Federalist Society and make a list of prospects. Trump did that.\n\nFor months, McConnell, the consummate political insider, has been dispensing his counsel to Trump, the ultimate outsider, who has been absorbing the Kentuckian’s words. The dynamic has provided a degree of stability in the still-forming relationship between the low-key Senate leader and the loquacious president, who are starkly different types of people.\n\nBut cracks have also emerged in their partnership, most notably when Trump has casually suggested that McConnell change the long-standing rules of the Senate and McConnell has bluntly brushed him off.\n\nTheir fragile alliance is about to face its biggest challenge yet in the next phase of the Republican effort to overhaul the nation’s health-care laws. The work of revising major parts of the act known as Obamacare is now in the Senate’s hands after the House narrowly passed its own bill following months of destructive Republican infighting.\n\nTrump, then the president-elect, walks through the Capitol Building with his wife Melania, left, Nov. 10 after meeting with McConnell, right. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nAt stake is the long-term future of the American health-care system and the near-term future of the new Republican-controlled government — which has yet to shepherd any major legislative proposals into law.\n\n“Whether or not they are able to forge a positive, personal and working relationship will be one of the early tests of this,” said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele.\n\n[Health care is now set to be a defining issue in the next election cycles]\n\nIt will be as much a make-or-break moment for McConnell as for Trump. The Senate leader has so far been able to fly below the radar on health care as House Republicans worked through their disagreements before ultimately passing a bill. If he cannot do the same, he is likely to be blamed for the collapse of the effort to fulfill a signature GOP campaign promise.\n\nMcConnell is cool and deliberative while Trump is hot and impetuous. But they have privately developed what people close to them say is a respectful relationship.\n\nIn the 75-year-old majority leader, Trump, 70, sees a senior player in navigating the ways of Washington, in both age and experience. He views him as someone on his level — or at least more on his level than many other Republicans, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nIn some regards, McConnell has become a tutor to Trump. The two men speak regularly, with McConnell initiating some calls to guide the novice president.\n\n(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\n“Leader McConnell has been a great resource in giving guidance and counsel on a myriad of issues in the first few months,” said one senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, talking generically about McConnell.\n\nIt was McConnell, after all, who helped hand Trump his only major congressional victory during his first 100 days in office: the confirmation of Gorsuch to the high court. In nominating Gorsuch, who won wide praise in conservative circles, Trump also aided McConnell by helping him pay off his gamble to hold the seat open during the presidential campaign.\n\nThose close to McConnell say that his relationship with Trump is rooted in trying to accomplish the things Republicans campaigned on last year — no more, no less.\n\n“The funny thing — everybody used to ask McConnell if he got along with Barack Obama,” said Josh Holmes, McConnell’s former chief of staff. “And he said it’s irrelevant if he got along. It’s, ‘Can we work together?’ ”\n\nBut Holmes said McConnell is “allergic to drama” and “does not see the business of governing as a soap opera. It’s a business that should be handled professionally.” That ideal has been complicated time and again by Trump’s controversial policies and pronouncements.\n\nThat is one area where McConnell’s private lobbying has made little difference. In an interview with The Washington Post earlier this year, McConnell made it clear that he was not a fan of Trump’s hostile Twitter habits. He said that he liked what Trump was doing a lot more than what he was writing on social media.\n\n“We’ve had very candid conversations about that. And as you can see, my advice has not made a bit of difference,” McConnell said.\n\n[The Take: Can the GOP sell its health-care proposal to a skeptical public?]\n\nThe health-care debate in the Senate is expected be a more-complicated endeavor than Gorsuch’s confirmation or the short-term government-spending deal the White House recently reached with Congress. It will test McConnell’s ability to influence Trump behind the scenes as never before.\n\nMcConnell aides and allies are hoping that the White House will let the Senate work through its differences on health care without setting artificial deadlines or trying to hurry the process ahead.\n\n“We’re not going to rush it,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), one of McConnell’s top lieutenants.\n\nSenate Republicans have shown little regard for the controversial House bill, signaling that they are going to write their own measure. A working group of 13 GOP senators from different parts of the ideological spectrum is meeting twice a week to talk about how to move ahead.\n\n“The Senate is the place, still, in my view, where you deliberate, you have a say, you vote,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nThe Trump administration has been working with the Senate and House along “dual tracks” on health care, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. McConnell aides and allies said that they expected the president’s team to be heavily involved in the process moving forward.\n\nBut part of McConnell’s challenge will be convincing Trump that the methodical pace at which the Senate moves is necessary.\n\n“Here [in Congress], it’s just the slow pace that is very hard for anyone coming out of the private sector as a CEO to become comfortable with,” said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) a Trump ally, in a recent interview.\n\nBut some of the long-standing Senate norms and customs to which McConnell claims to be committed have been shrugged off by Trump as mere inconveniences in the lawmaking process. Trump suggested Tuesday on Twitter that it might be time to do away with the 60-vote Senate threshold on legislation, which empowers the minority party.\n\n“We’re not going to do that,” McConnell said dismissively later that day, arguing that “it would fundamentally change the way the Senate has worked for a very long time.”\n\nEven as the relationship between McConnell and Trump has seen its share of tensions, it has generally been better than Trump’s relationship with Ryan, who wavered in his support of Trump during the campaign.\n\nMcConnell was never Trump’s biggest cheerleader in 2016, but he supported him and generally kept his criticism narrowly focused on words Trump spoke or actions he took that bothered him.\n\n[Republicans’ health-care plan could launch some ugly political battles in state legislatures]\n\nThat small measure of loyalty in the trenches has been remembered in the West Wing. McConnell, unlike Ryan, has not been saddled with a reputation as a fair-weather friend.\n\n“McConnell never took his eye off the ball and lost sight of the fact that at the end of the day, no matter what individual issue was happening, it was going to be Trump or [Democratic nominee Hillary] Clinton,” said Scott Jennings, a former McConnell strategist, noting that he “far preferred Trump.”\n\nEven in Trump’s administration, which is filled with political newcomers, the reach of McConnell’s vast network of former staffers and allies from more than 32 years in the Senate can be felt. McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, is Trump’s transportation secretary. Amy Swonger, Trump’s head of the Senate Legislative affairs team, is a former McConnell aide. So is Andrew Bremberg, director of the Domestic Policy Council.\n\nOn the whole, though, Trump’s team is largely bereft of experienced Senate tacticians. In addition to dealing with Trump, McConnell deals mainly with Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, budget director Mick Mulvaney and Vice President Pence, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nFor Trump, the health-care debate in the Senate will not only depend on how well he can work with McConnell. It is also likely to rest on his interaction with rank-and-file Republican senators.\n\nAs the House was working on its health-care bill, Trump held meetings with centrist and conservative GOP members as he sought to build support for the measure. But some McConnell allies doubt that kind of courtship will work as well in the Senate.\n\n“I’m not sure that U.S. senators that have been in office for a long time and have their own opinions and ideas of on legislation need some hand-holding from outside entities,” said Jennings, the former McConnell strategist. In the House, he added, “maybe they needed a little more prodding and guiding.”","author":"Sean Sullivan, Abby Phillip, Paul Kane, Sean Sullivan, Abby Phillip, Paul Kane","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T08:41:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/11/10/National-Politics/Images/TRUMPHILL20071478809811.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"tk6bDVTVgP5Ls4uin50Emg==\n"}

(Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post)\n\nWhen House Republicans posted enough votes to pass their plan to revamp the nation’s health-care system Thursday, Democrats broke out into song. So convinced it was a political loser, Democratic lawmakers sang “Nah Nah Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” the way victorious sports fans jeer their opponents.\n\nTheir head of candidate recruitment guaranteed that Republicans would “pay a price” in 2018, saying he planned to use the controversial legislation as an incentive for prospective Democratic candidates to jump into races. “I have a significant number of hours blocked out to make phone calls,” Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) said.\n\nBut Democrats might be guilty of some premature exuberance. There are two major obstacles standing in their way to putting together a strong campaign to win back the House majority: their own internal divisions and time.\n\nDemocrats are — slowly but surely — engaging in the sort of infighting that usually happens right after losing a presidential election. That reckoning was delayed because President Trump’s stunning victory last November created a fierce energy among Democrats to fight the new administration at every turn, forging a common bond from the party’s coastal liberals to its Midwestern moderates.\n\nThat early anti-Trump unity, however, papered over deep divisions about what went wrong during the campaign and what the party should do ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nThat’s all changing now.\n\nPelosi: Democratic candidates should not be forced to toe party line on abortion\n\nA perfect example came last week when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in an interview with The Washington Post, dismissed complaints from abortion rights activists who do not want party resources to help any antiabortion Democrat.\n\n“This is the Democratic Party, this is not a rubber stamp party. This is a party of great diversity,” Pelosi told the Post Tuesday, noting that many Catholic family members who she grew up with in Baltimore’s Little Italy neighborhood remain opposed to abortion. “You think I’m kicking them out of the Democratic Party?”\n\nWithin hours, Pelosi’s comments sparked a fury.\n\nSome praised Pelosi’s candor, recognizing that the the Affordable Care Act and other key items of the Obama administration would not have passed in 2009 and 2010 without the support of antiabortion House Democrats.\n\n“Straight forward and sensible,” David Axelrod, the former top strategist to Barack Obama, tweeted.\n\nOthers lashed out at Pelosi.\n\n“Encouraging and supporting anti-choice candidates leads to bad policy outcomes that violate women’s rights and endanger our economic security,” Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, told The Post.\n\n“We are dismayed by Minority Leader Pelosi’s out-of-touch and self-serving statements that throw women and their right to make their own moral decisions under the bus,” Jon O’Brien, president of Catholics for Choice, said in a statement.\n\nThe fact that Pelosi — a heroine to most liberals, the first female House speaker and a leader on women’s rights for decades — came under fire speaks volumes about how much Democratic grievances are left to be fully aired before the midterms.\n\nIn March, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another liberal icon, backed off her original support of Ben Carson as secretary of Housing and Urban Development. She had supported Carson in a committee vote and then faced an outcry from anti-Trump activists, leading to a Daily Kos story headlined “The Resistance Crumbles.” She then voted against Carson in the full Senate vote five weeks later.\n\nOther disputes are coming to the forefront because elections are underway again, reopening old wounds from the hard fought 2016 presidential primary between Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has devoted nearly unlimited resources to the special election for a House seat in the suburbs north of Atlanta. It’s considered a beta test for the 2018 plan to target dozens of Republican districts in highly educated, diverse suburbs outside Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles and other cities.\n\nBut Sanders did not endorse the leading Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff, until after he fell just shy of the 50-percent threshold in initial balloting, forcing him into a June runoff election.\n\nAlmost no resources went to a special election in southern Kansas and a modest sum has gone to the race for Montana’s at-large seat in the House, prompting Sanders to deliver a rebuke to the DCCC for not doing as much to help in those races.\n\nFor their gubernatorial nomination, Virginia Democrats will decide between former representative Tom Perriello, supported by Sanders, or Ralph Northam, the lieutenant governor who has the backing of Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime confidant of the Clintons.\n\nDemocrats turn to Sanders and his star power to rebuild the party\n\nDemocratic leaders like to say that they aren’t divided on policy grounds the way Republicans are. GOP leaders in Congress tend to support free trade and have more open views to immigration, while their conservative base has embraced much of Trump’s America-first nativist vision.\n\nThose divisions were on display as House Republicans struggled for two months to find the votes to pass their repeal of the ACA, creating more optimism among Democrats that they can win big in next year’s elections.\n\nBut there is so much time until then. In the previous three election cycles, Democrats essentially won the messaging wars in the odd year, only to flounder in the even year when ballots were actually cast.\n\nTake 2011, when the new Republican majority approved the fiscal blueprint of Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the future House speaker who then chaired the House Budget Committee. It included a proposal to turn Medicare into a voucher program, and that spring, Democrats won a special election in Upstate New York largely by campaigning against Ryan’s budget.\n\nBut Ryan’s Medicare proposal went nowhere and faded from the public consciousness, even after he was chosen as the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2012.\n\nThere’s a real chance that Ryan’s health-care legislation could fade away as senior Senate Republicans vow to write their own version of the bill.\n\nThat’s why Democrats are focusing on creating a unified front in the coming months around an economic agenda, because they are going to need votes from across the ideological spectrum to win the 24 seats needed to win back the House majority. They’re going to need votes from people like Pelosi’s family who support the party’s position on boosting middle-class income but oppose its stance on abortion rights.\n\n“They’re there to fight for people’s rights, working families,” Pelosi said of her loyal Democratic family members. “What are we talking about here? In our caucus, one thing unifies us: our values, about working families.”\n\nRead more from Paul Kane’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.","author":"Paul Kane, Paul Kane","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T10:26:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/06/National-Politics/Images/IMG_0501.JPG","class":"Technology","digest":"+4mR3l4CTEh//2Yq5Ei0PQ==\n"}

Labrador (R-Idaho) defended the GOP health care bill at a town hall in southern Idaho on May 5. (Tom Hansen)\n\nA conservative Republican congressman from Idaho is drawing criticism for his response to a town-hall attendee’s concerns about how his party’s health-care bill would affect Medicaid recipients.\n\n“You are mandating people on Medicaid to accept dying,” the woman said.\n\n“That line is so indefensible,” said Rep. Raúl R. Labrador, a member of the influential House Freedom Caucus. “Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care.”\n\nThe boos instantly drowned him out.\n\nThe town hall meeting occurred at Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho, a day after Labrador and 216 other Republicans in the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act, which would overhaul the country’s health-care system.\n\nRep. Raúl R. Labrador, R-Idaho. (John Miller/Associated Press)\n\nThe bill was passed hastily, with few public hearings and key revisions agreed upon during closed-door meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill. The Congressional Budget Office had not analyzed the bill’s cost and impact on coverage before it was approved by the House, but the agency’s analysis of its original version projected that 24 million would lose insurance by 2026.\n\n[This is not the health-care bill that Trump promised]\n\nThe estimate also showed that the bill would cut $880 billion from the Medicaid program over the next decade. The program provides health insurance to low-income Americans and helps pay for long-term care for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nAfter the town hall Friday, Labrador said on his Facebook page, “It was my privilege to spend two hours today in Lewiston fielding questions from my constituents, many of them about our efforts to provide quality health care to all Americans at an affordable and sustainable cost.”\n\nBut many of the comments to his post were in response to his earlier statement.\n\n“My brother died because he was poor and could not go to a doctor because he couldn’t afford the bills. He is dead. People die because they don’t have access to healthcare,” one Facebook user wrote.\n\n“Quite a few middle-aged people sitting in your audience that you just aced out of health coverage,” another one said.\n\nTwitter also has been flooded with angry posts.\n\nA spokesman for Labrador did not respond Saturday to an email seeking comment.\n\n[Will repealing Obamacare really kill 60,000 people?]\n\nAs The Washington Post’s Carolyn Y. Johnson wrote, figuring out exactly how many people would die if access to health care is taken away is not an easy estimate to reach. Johnson wrote:\n\nThat’s because the law’s most widespread feature is helping people buy health insurance, and the link between being covered by health insurance and actually being healthier is not fully understood. … health is a cumulative, complex and long-term outcome, determined not only by health insurance status, but by socioeconomic factors, genetics, lifestyle and the neighborhoods where people live. The differences between having insurance and not having insurance often encapsulates a broad swath of other factors that affect people’s well-being.\n\nIt would not, however, be a leap to say that losing health insurance would make someone’s health worse and might even lead to death. Studies have drawn connections between lack of access to health care and mortality rate.\n\nA 2009 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that 45,000 deaths annually were linked to lack of health coverage, and that uninsured, working-age Americans have a 40 percent higher risk of dying than their insured counterparts.\n\nAccording to another 2009 study by the Institute of Medicine, people without health care are more likely to die if diagnosed with illnesses, such as cancer, congestive heart failure, diabetes and heart attack, among others.\n\n[‘Does it pass the Jimmy Kimmel test?’ asks senator who authored proposal to replace Obamacare]\n\nOn the other hand, those with access to health care are likely to fare better.\n\nA recent study on young adults found that the average mortality rate among those between ages 19 and 25 who have contracted diseases have dropped by 3 to 6 percent because of expanded coverage. The study examined the impact of an Obamacare provision that allowed young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance until they’re 26.\n\nHouse Republicans celebrated with the White House Thursday after narrowly passing the controversial repeal-and-replace bill.\n\nIn a statement after the bill was passed, Labrador said, “We have negotiated legislation that keeps our promise to the American people to lower health costs while also protecting those with preexisting conditions. Furthermore, unlike the first version of the AHCA, our bill showed it had enough support to actually pass the House.”\n\nAn amendment to the bill would allow states to obtain a waiver so they could charge customers with preexisting conditions more than other people. The latest addition, which would provide $8 billion over five years to lower premiums for those with preexisting conditions, swayed some concerned moderate Republican lawmakers to support the bill, allowing the House GOP leadership to secure enough votes to pass it.\n\nDemocrats, however, say the $8 billion is not enough and those with preexisting conditions will face the choice of paying exorbitant premiums or carrying no insurance.\n\nThe contentious fight to repeal and replace Obamacare is likely to continue on Capitol Hill, as Senate Republicans have indicated that they plan to write their own legislation. Whether it would have similar features as the House bill, or if it would be something entirely different remains unclear.\n\nLabrador is not the first Republican lawmaker to face a hostile crowd during a town hall meeting.

Kimmel teared up while discussing his newborn son Billy's heart condition on his show. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)\n\nA Republican senator came up with a new phrase to promote a bill he has pitched to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“Does it pass the Jimmy Kimmel test?” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who introduced legislation that would replace Obamacare while keeping some of its most popular features, said Friday in an interview with CNN. “Would a child born with congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in the first year of life? I want it to pass the Jimmy Kimmel test.”\n\nCassidy, a physician, was answering a question about whether he'd support a bill that allows insurance companies to cap their payout to customers. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are not allowed to limit how much they would pay out in benefits to cover health care in a person's lifetime. Children born with serious health problems, like Kimmel's, are likely to hit those limits early in life.\n\nCassidy's comments came just a few days after Kimmel revealed that his newborn son has congenital heart disease. The late-night host began his show Monday with a tearful opening about his son's open-heart surgery, which he described as “the longest three hours of my life.”\n\nSenator @BillCassidy on insurance firms capping customer payouts: \"Does it pass the Jimmy Kimmel test?\" https://t.co/8fr65KMoFS — CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) May 5, 2017\n\n“Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son, there was a good chance you would never be able to get health insurance because you had a preexisting condition. You were born with a preexisting condition, and if your parents didn't have medical insurance, you might not even live long enough to get denied because of a preexisting condition,” Kimmel said, adding later his plea regarding the health-care debate: “This isn't football; there are not teams. We are the team; it's the United States. Don't let their partisan squabbles divide us on something every decent person wants. We need to care for each other.”\n\n[Republicans’ health-care plan could launch some ugly political battles in state legislatures]\n\nOn Friday, Cassidy said on CNN that his proposal, dubbed the Cassidy-Collins bill, does not impose lifetime limits and protects people with preexisting conditions — some of Obamacare's most popular provisions. The bill, introduced in January, also would keep the provision allowing those age 26 and under to stay on their parents' health insurance.\n\n“I want to make sure … that if a child is born and has Tetralogy of Fallot — I think that's what the child had — that they would receive all the services even if they go over a certain amount,” Cassidy said. “So, simple answer, I want to make sure folks get the care they need.”\n\nSenator @BillCassidy \"the senate will write its own bill,\" says he will push to \"expand risk pools\" https://t.co/m7jsBHKj4V — CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) May 5, 2017\n\nAn amendment added to the American Health Care Act, which House Republicans narrowly passed Thursday, would allow states to obtain a waiver so they could charge customers with preexisting conditions more than other people. The latest addition, which would provide $8 billion over five years to lower premiums for those with preexisting conditions, swayed concerned lawmakers to support the bill, allowing House Republicans to secure enough votes to pass it.\n\nDemocrats, however, say the $8 billion is not enough and that those with preexisting conditions will face the choice of paying exorbitant premiums or carrying no insurance.\n\nCassidy and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) had introduced the Patient Freedom Act, which would create larger risk pools to keep costs down for those with serious health problems.\n\nThe bill also would repeal Obamacare mandates that require individuals and business owners to buy insurance and shift health-care decisions to the states. Under the bill, states would also have the option to keep the plan they have in place today.\n\n\" … so that those who are sicker, if you will, aren't in a pool of those who are younger and healthier,” Cassidy said. “It works. That's how every big risk pool does it. We have a plan on how to address that.”\n\n[Is this Jimmy Kimmel’s defining moment?]\n\n“If you like your insurance, you should keep it, and we mean it,” Cassidy said in January.\n\nAs House Republicans celebrated with the White House on Thursday passing the House GOP version of the repeal-and-replace bill, Senate Republicans made clear that they intended to come up with their own proposal. Whether that would be Cassidy and Collins's bill, some version of it or something entirely different remains unclear.\n\nPerhaps an ominous signal of what is likely to be an uphill battle in the Senate is a tweet from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a co-sponsor of Cassidy and Collins's bill:\n\nA bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) May 4, 2017\n\nOn CNN on Friday, Cassidy dodged a question on whether the House bill sufficiently protects people with preexisting conditions.\n\n“We don't have a score on the House bill, but let's just speak to the positive. Because I think if we focus on the House bill, we're totally ignoring what the process is going to be,” he said. “The process is that moving forward, the Senate will write its own bill.”\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has yet to have a forecast on how the House bill would affect people's health care, but an estimate on the bill's original version indicated that 24 million more people would be uninsured by 2026 than under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEmily Yahr and Kelsey Snell contributed to this story.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nDespite critics’ claims, the GOP health bill doesn’t classify rape or sexual assault as a preexisting condition\n\nWhat is in the Republican health-care bill?

(Emily Rauhala/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Kushner family came to the United States as refugees, worked hard and made it big — and if you invest in Kushner properties, so can you.\n\nThat was the message delivered Saturday by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner’s sister Nicole Kushner Meyer to a ballroom full of wealthy Chinese investors in Beijing.\n\nOver several hours of slide shows and presentations, representatives from the Kushner family business urged Chinese citizens gathered at a Ritz-Carlton hotel to consider investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a New Jersey luxury apartment complex that would help them secure what’s known as an investor visa.\n\nThe potential investors were advised to invest sooner rather than later in case visa rules change under the Trump administration. “Invest early, and you will invest under the old rules,” one speaker said.\n\nThe tagline on a brochure for the event: “Invest $500,000 and immigrate to the United States.”\n\nThe reception desk at the Ritz-Carlton. (Emily Rauhala/The Washington Post)\n\nAnd the highlight of the afternoon was Meyer, a principal for the company, who was introduced in promotional materials as Jared’s sister.\n\nThe event underscores the extent to which Kushner’s private business interests have the potential to collide with his powerful role as a top official in his father-in-law’s White House, particularly when it comes to China, where Kushner has become a crucial diplomatic channel between Beijing and the new administration.\n\nWhile Kushner has reported divesting from elements of the family business, including the specific project that his sister pitched in Beijing, the session Saturday demonstrated that the company is perceived as enjoying close ties to the Trump administration. Ethics laws prohibit government officials from profiting personally from their public-sector work.\n\nWatchdogs and ethics experts on Saturday criticized the Beijing event as an attempt to cash in on Kushner’s newfound proximity to power.\n\n“It’s incredibly stupid and highly inappropriate,” said Richard Painter, the former chief White House ethics lawyer in President George W. Bush’s administration, who has become a vocal critic of the Trump administration. “They clearly imply that the Kushners are going to make sure you get your visa. . . . They’re [Chinese applicants] not going to take a chance. Of course they’re going to want to invest.”\n\nAmong the wealthy elites in China, family, business and politics are all deeply intertwined. Every branch of the Communist Party, every province and city often operates as a fiefdom for those in power, allowing leaders special, lucrative access to policy, land and government contracts. There is even a name for second-generation sons and daughters of wealthy business executives and government officials — such as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner — who have access to power through family ties. They are called “fuerdai.”\n\n(Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\n\nThe EB-5 immigrant investor visa program that Meyer discussed Saturday allows rich foreign investors who are willing to plunk down large investments in U.S. projects that create jobs to apply to immigrate to the United States.\n\nBloomberg reported in March 2016 that the program has been used to the benefit both the Trump and Kushner family businesses. Before joining the White House, as chief executive of his family’s real estate company, Jared Kushner raised $50 million from Chinese EB-5 applicants for a Trump-branded apartment building in Jersey City, according to the report.\n\nBlake Roberts, an attorney at the WilmerHale law firm who serves as Kushner’s personal counsel, said: “Mr. Kushner divested his interests in the One Journal Square project by selling them to a family trust that he is not a beneficiary of, a mechanism suggested by the Office of Government Ethics. As previously stated, he will recuse from particular matters concerning the EB-5 visa program.”\n\nThe EB-5 program has been criticized by members of Congress from both parties who have said the program in essence sells visas to the wealthiest foreigners.\n\nThe program has been extremely popular among rich Chinese, who call it the “golden visa” and are eager to get their families — and their wealth — out of the country. The fact that some use it to move their money out illegally, however, has made the program unpopular with the Chinese authorities.\n\nThe program was launched with the goal of securing investment and creating jobs. But instead, in recent years, many real estate developers have used the program as a source of cheap financing by using foreign investors, especially from China, for flashy projects in Manhattan and other city centers.\n\nA Government Accountability Office report in 2015 found the EB-5 program carried a high risk of fraud, was rife with counterfeit documentation and had “no reliable method to verify the source of the funds of petitioners.”\n\nSince Donald Trump became president, rumors have circulated among the wealthy of the world about the future of the EB-5 program, given Trump’s repeated vows to crack down on immigration and the increased congressional scrutiny of EB-5s. That has sent many high-rolling foreigners flocking to apply.\n\nThe program, however, is especially popular in China, with estimates in recent years showing that more than 80 percent of EB-5 visas were issued to Chinese investors.\n\nSaturday’s event in Beijing was hosted by the Chinese company Qiaowai, which connects U.S. companies with Chinese investors. Qiaowai is working with the Kushner company to secure funding for Kushner 1, the New Jersey project presented to investors, also known as One Journal Square. Promotional materials tout the buildings’ proximity to Manhattan and note that the project will create more than 6,000 jobs.\n\n“This project has stable funding, creates sufficient jobs and guarantees the safety of investors’ money,” one description reads.\n\nAlthough there was no visible reference to Trump, the materials noted the Kushner family’s “celebrity” status.\n\nWhite House officials declined to comment. A spokesman for the Kushner company also declined to comment.\n\nKushner’s personal financial disclosure form reflects that he divested his interest in K One Journal Square LLC. The form described the asset as undeveloped real estate in Jersey City. Because the asset was already divested, Kushner’s filing does not reflect its estimated value. But he did report between $1 million and $5 million in income connected to the project.\n\nAt Saturday’s event, attendee Wang Yun, a Chinese investor, said the Kushner family’s ties to Trump were an obvious part of the project’s appeal.\n\n“Even though this is the project of the son-in-law’s family, of course it is still affiliated,” Wang said.\n\nWang reasoned that the link to Trump would be a boon if the presidency goes well but could be disastrous if it does not: “We heard that there are rumors that he is the most likely to be impeached president in American history. That’s why I doubt this project.”\n\nMany of the people who attended the event declined to be interviewed, citing privacy concerns, or were blocked by organizers from speaking to the news media.\n\nAlthough the event was publicly advertised in Beijing, the hosts were exceptionally anxious about the presence of reporters.\n\nJournalists were initially seated at the back of the ballroom, but as the presentations got underway, a public-relations representative asked The Washington Post to leave, saying the presence of foreign reporters threatened the “stability” of the event.\n\nAt one point, organizers grabbed a reporter’s phone and backpack to try to force that person to leave. Later, as investors started leaving the ballroom, organizers physically surrounded attendees to prevent them from giving interviews.\n\nAsked why reporters were asked to leave, a PR person who declined to identify herself said simply, “This is not the story we want.”\n\nRead more\n\nChina policy is now a (Kushner) family affair\n\nKushner has a singular and almost untouchable role in Trump’s White House\n\nI worked for Jared Kushner.

Even with the last-minute release of thousands of hacked Macron campaign documents, analysts said the scale of his lead gave Le Pen little hope of eking out a victory.\n\n“Her chances are very weak,” said Olivier Rouquan, a political analyst at Pantheon-Assas II University.\n\nA Le Pen loss, however, will hardly be a knockout blow for populism — or a ringing vindication of the establishment.\n\nIf anything, the French campaign has solidified the new fracture lines in modern politics, which bear little relation to the relatively modest differences marking the old left-right divide. Instead, the choice voters face on Sunday illustrates the profound new chasm in the West: between those who favor open, globalized societies and others who prefer closed, nationalized ones.\n\n“What’s the common ground between Macron and Le Pen? There is none. What we’re seeing is historic: a choice between two completely different modes of organizing a society,” said Madani Cheurfa, a professor of politics at Paris’s Sciences Po. “The world is focused on France because France has managed to encapsulate — almost to the point of caricature — the debate underway across the world.”\n\nAlready knocked out of the presidential race are the two mainstream parties, the Socialists and the Republicans, which have led France for much of its recent history. Both had allowed their messages to become muddled and strained as they attempted to straddle the new divide.\n\nThe candidates who are left are unapologetic champions of their respective camps. They rarely try to reach across to those in the other. Their supporters see the world in ways that often seem diametrically opposed.\n\nMacron, a 39-year-old former banker and economy minister, celebrates immigration as a cultural and economic force for good. Flags with the E.U.’s blue field and gold stars are a common sight at his rallies, and he enthusiastically endorses the bloc as the continent’s best guarantor of peace. His supporters tend to be educated, urban and optimistic.\n\n[Marion Maréchal-Le Pen: ‘We’ve won the battle of ideas’]\n\nLe Pen, the 48-year-old leader of a far-right party that her father founded in the 1970s, rails against the evils of mass immigration and warns that France is losing its identity amid a tide of mostly Muslim newcomers. She has called for the dismantling of the E.U., threatened to take France out of NATO and heaped praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Her backers tend to be rural, white, less educated and, without a radical shift in direction, gloomy about France’s future.\n\nUntil recently, the option embodied by Le Pen wasn’t even on the ballot for votes like the one Sunday. When it was — her father, convicted Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen, made the final round of the French presidential vote in 2002 — it was defeated by a massive margin.\n\nBut Marine Le Pen has kept this year’s contest reasonably competitive until its final days, and is on track to more than double her father’s vote share from 15 years ago.\n\nThat trend explains why, even if Macron claims the presidency on Sunday, his supporters say they will be more relieved than exultant.\n\n“If we win, we have five years to do something with it,” said Aurélie Quartier, a former elementary school teacher who was handing out Macron fliers near a subway stop in a working-class neighborhood of eastern Paris this past week. “Otherwise [Le Pen] will be elected in the first round in 2022.”\n\nQuartier, 38, said she had never been involved in politics until this year, when she realized that Le Pen’s National Front could actually take hold of the Élysee Palace. The thought chilled her, and galvanized her.\n\nSo she’s been out on the streets every day for the past month, talking to her neighbors and trying to convince them that regardless of how they feel about Macron, they need to vote for him to block Le Pen.\n\nShe was nervous enough about the result that on Friday, she started her work at 8 a.m. and didn’t plan to stop until 11:59 p.m. — the final minute that campaigning was legally allowed.\n\n“I want to be able to say I did everything I could,” she said as she stood beside a poster of a grinning Macron and the name of his movement, Onward.\n\nTo Quartier, Le Pen and her movement represent an affront to the multicultural way of life that Quartier has come to know in a neighborhood where the smell of Turkish spices wafts from the weekly market, and the corner grocery store is run by an Arab owner who specializes in Serbian fare.\n\nThe choice on Sunday, Quartier said, is elemental.\n\n“Do we remain ourselves, or do we give in to the worst inside us?” she asked. “To feel fear and rejection is human. But do we surrender to that and say, ‘I don’t like you because you don’t look like me?’ Or do we try to bring out the best in ourselves? It’s the best versus the worst.”\n\n[A youth revolt in France boosts the far right]\n\nFor Eve Froger, a 20-year-old law student, Sunday presents France with an equally dramatic decision. But it’s Macron who’s the threat, and Le Pen who’s the country’s would-be savior.\n\n“I’m worried about unemployment and housing and security and the defense of French identity,” she said. “France comes from a Judeo-Christian culture, and we have to defend it on a daily basis. Too often we deny our identity in favor of globalism.”\n\nShe decided at the age of 18 that the only party that spoke to her concerns was the National Front. Froger has been campaigning for the party ever since, handing out leaflets, blasting pro-Le Pen messages on social media and only taking time out from this spring’s presidential contest to study for exams.\n\nRaised by a single mother in a hardscrabble Paris suburb, Froger said affluent and cosmopolitan city-dwellers have little idea of the problems facing ordinary French citizens.\n\nShe was pleased when Macron won a place in the second round against Le Pen because Froger sees him as the sharpest contrast to her champion, the ultimate symbol of an out-of-touch, globalized elite.\n\n“He’s a man of the financial system with no compassion for the people of France,” Froger said. “He only cares about himself and the E.U. What defines this election is on one side the defense of the E.U.’s interests and on the other side the defense of France’s interests.”\n\nRouquan, the analyst, said it’s unlikely a majority of French voters will agree — this time, at least. But assuming he wins, Macron will be under immediate pressure to do something he hasn’t during the campaign: reach out to Le Pen voters and convince them he’s committed to making their lives better. Otherwise, their ranks could soon grow.\n\n“Marine Le Pen is making progress, step by step,” Rouquan said. “Next time, she could make it to power.”\n\nVirgile Demoustier contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nMarine Le Pen wants to be France’s future.

(Onward) political movement, is cheered as he delivers a speech Friday during an election campaign rally in Albi, France. (Frederic Scheiber/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nThe French call it “the past that will not pass.”\n\nThis year’s election in France has proven that phrase — first coined by prominent French historian Henry Rousso — to be more than prescient. In subtle and not-so-subtle ways, France’s complicity in the Holocaust and, to a profound degree, its colonial crimes have been defining themes of the most contentious presidential campaign in recent memory. When voters go to the polls Sunday, they will choose between warring interpretations of France’s past as much as between different visions for its future.\n\nEmmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, the two candidates in the final round of the vote, are distinct in many ways. Macron, a former investment banker and the darling of Parisian and academic elites, is a boyish acolyte of cosmopolitan Europe; Le Pen, a hard-line nationalist, is an advocate of economic protectionism and closed borders. But rarely are the two more opposed than when they talk about history, as they have done frequently throughout a long and bitter campaign.\n\n[In French debate, insults fly]\n\n(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nFor Le Pen — the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, a convicted Holocaust denier who repeatedly has dismissed the Nazi gas chambers as a “detail of history” — the past is nothing to be ashamed of. Last month, she remarked on national television that France bore no responsibility for an infamous Paris roundup during the Holocaust, when French authorities arrested some 13,000 Jews, soon deported to their deaths.\n\nApproximately 76,000 Jews were deported from France to the Nazi concentration camps during World War II. Most never returned.\n\n“If there were those responsible,” Le Pen said, “it was those who were in power at the time. This is not France.”\n\nVersions of Holocaust denial and revisionism have clouded Le Pen’s National Front party throughout the 2017 campaign. In early March, a party official in Nice was caught on camera saying that “there weren’t mass killings as it’s been said.” In late April, Jean-François Jalkh, Le Pen’s appointed deputy of the National Front during the closing days of the campaign, was reported to have said — in an on-the-record interview in 2000 — that the Nazis never used the poison gas Zyklon B to exterminate millions of Jews and others.\n\n“From a technical point of view it’s impossible,” Jalkh allegedly said in that interview, although since then he has claimed he can’t remember saying so and sued the Le Monde newspaper for presenting him as a Holocaust denier.\n\nMacron, by contrast, has chosen — at significant political risk — to confront head-on other dark chapters of France’s past, especially colonialism. Some say the tactic stems from his early days as an assistant to the late French intellectual Paul Ricoeur, whose work often examined the intersections of history and memory.\n\n[Emmanuel Macron could fight off French populism. But it won’t be with his ideas.]\n\nIn one of Macron’s most controversial decisions on the campaign trial, he went in February to Algeria, which France had annexed for 132 years, and called on the French state to apologize formally for its crimes as a colonial power, especially in the bloody war for Algerian independence between 1954 and 1962. France’s history in that war, Macron said in an interview days later, represented “crimes and acts of barbarism” that today deserve to be labeled “crimes against humanity.”\n\nFor months, Le Pen has harped on Macron for those three words, accusing him once again in a televised debate Wednesday of “insulting” the French people.\n\nIn a high-profile case, her father, in the 2002 presidential campaign, was accused of torture during the Algerian War — charges that the elder Le Pen vehemently disputes.\n\nBenjamin Stora, France’s preeminent expert on colonial Algerian history and a founding member of Paris’s National Museum of the History of Immigration, said in an interview that the outcry over Macron’s declaration has highlighted the ways in which, at least in this election, the past remains present.\n\n“For many people, colonialism has always been a distant abstraction, a peripheral problem,” he said. “But no one today who is honest can see it that way anymore. The question of immigration is a central question in our society and in many ways, the question.”\n\nSo many of the problems in French society today, Stora said, stem from the aftermath of France’s colonial history — and the French state’s struggles to integrate immigrants from across the once-expansive French empire.\n\n“If you don’t know the history of Algeria, you cannot understand France in 2017,” he said.\n\nThis year’s election has widely been regarded as historic, with both principal candidates representing parties outside the center-left and center-right that have governed the country since 1958. Many even have pondered the degree to which this election represents a departure from the statist model envisioned by Charles de Gaulle, with a president as a powerful executive who embodies the dignity of the nation.\n\nFor some, however, the prospect of a National Front victory at the presidential level is the opposite of a new development.\n\n“When you place them within the framework of the continuity of French history, you cannot find one single new element brought by the Le Pen family and their movement,” Zeev Sternhell, a prominent historian of French fascism, said in an interview. “This is classic hard-right nationalism with the usual xenophobia, the hatred of the ‘other’ and the cult of the people against the elite.”\n\n[France’s National Front forced to replace party leader who denied Nazis used poison gas]\n\nThat ideology, Sternhell added, has been a constant in French history since 1789, manifesting throughout the 19th century. It appeared, Sternhell said, in episodes such as the “Dreyfus affair,” when a Jewish military captain was wrongly accused of treason, and later during the Vichy government in World War II, when a long-dormant far right capitalized on military defeat to take power.\n\nA Le Pen victory in 2017, Sternhell said, “would be an anti-Enlightenment and anti-liberal revolution.”\n\nFor Rousso, who recently was detained in the United States during President Trump ’s “travel ban,” one of the many issues at stake in France’s election is the politics of memory — especially complicated in a diverse society that blends a multitude of immigrant experiences.\n\n“A principal challenge for the next president of the republic will be to try and find a way to reconcile different memories,” he said. “And more importantly, divided memories.”\n\nIn the meantime, he said, the past is here to stay.\n\nRead more:\n\nAs France heads to the polls, there is little enthusiasm but a feeling that a lot is at stake\n\nMarine Le Pen rarely mentions gender issues, unless she’s talking about Muslims\n\nFrench voters face choice between hope and fear in runoff for presidency\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":"James McAuley, James McAuley","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T11:00:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/05/Foreign/Images/05944451.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"AjzY7X66IsnJpezOaJdJSg==\n"}

Here’s why French voters won’t hear much about them before Sunday’s election.","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/06/macrons-emails-got-hacked-heres-why-french-voters-wont-hear-much-about-them-before-sundays-election/","text":"\n\nFrench presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron. (Frederic Scheiber/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nLate Friday night, they appeared: thousands of pages of documents allegedly stolen from Emmanuel Macron's campaign. The data dump, which first appeared on the website Pastebin, included staffers' personal and professional emails, along with contracts and campaign finance information for the French presidential candidate.\n\nIn the United States, such leaked content would be the stuff of wall-to-wall media coverage. (See, for example, the thousands of articles and news segments produced about the Democratic National Committee's leaked emails.)\n\nIn France, though, the press has been noticeably silent. That's because France has a national moratorium on campaigning and media coverage. Starting 44 hours before a presidential election, the press and candidates are required by law to observe a “blackout.” (On Sunday, Macron will face Marine Le Pen in a runoff for the French presidency.)\n\nThe measure dates back half a century. It is designed to prevent a last-minute story from swaying the election, particularly before a campaign can respond or all the facts can be reported out. “If there were a scandal, it should have been exposed by Friday,” Pascal Jan, a professor of constitutional law at Sciences Po Bordeaux, told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nThat's why early Saturday morning, the country's electoral commission urged journalists and media outlets not to cover the contents of the leaks. In a statement, it called on news outlets to heed “the sense of responsibility they must demonstrate, as at stake are the free expression of voters and the sincerity of the election” itself. The commission also warned that, “the dissemination of such data, which has been fraudulently obtained and in all likelihood may have been mingled with false information, is liable to be classified as a criminal offense.”\n\nThe French media has largely obliged. According to Reuters, television channels have barely referenced the leak. Online, a handful of outlets are giving them play, but none highlight particular revelations.\n\nIn a statement, the newspaper Le Monde explained its decision to abide by the ruling. Analyzing the information and sussing out what's real and what's fake takes time, the French newspaper said. To publish something now would be a violation of its policies. “If these documents contain revelations, Le Monde will of course publish them after having investigated them, respecting our journalistic and ethical rules, and without allowing ourselves to be exploited by the publishing calendar of anonymous actors,” it said.\n\nThe moratorium also makes it impossible for Macron to respond to specific accusations, something that makes the media leery. Just minutes before the blackout, Macron's En Marche party announced that it had “been the victim of a massive and coordinated hack.” The campaign also said that the communications showed only the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, but that authentic documents and fake ones had been mixed on social media to sow “doubt and misinformation.”\n\nOne site, Numerama, did do a cursory sift of the leak. A full analysis, they warned, will take time. But at first glance, they write, “these are quite ordinary documents.”\n\n“There are briefing notes, bills, loans for amounts that are not excessive,” the site explained, along with “strictly personal and private exchanges — personal notes on rain and good weather, a confirmation email on the publication of a novel, the reservation of a table between friends.” Some documents, he wrote, don't seem to have any connection with Macron at all.\n\nOne place the blackout has not been observed? Social media.\n\nAs Ben Nimmo, a U.K.-based security researcher with the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council think tank, explained to Reuters, incorrect and unsubstantiated rumors about what the leaks contained began buzzing across the Internet on Friday night, spread largely by far-right Americans.\n\nAs he explained:\n\nThe leaks emerged on 4chan, a discussion forum popular with far right activists in the United States. An anonymous poster provided links to the documents on Pastebin, saying, “This was passed on to me today so now I am giving it to you, the people.” The hashtag #MacronLeaks was then spread by Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump activist whose Twitter profile identifies him as Washington D.C. bureau chief of the far-right activist site Rebel TV.\n\nBy Saturday morning, many Le Pen supporters shared the information, too. But experts doubt it'll make much difference. Largely, they say, the attitude toward the hack in France is nicely summed up here:","author":"Amanda Erickson, Amanda Erickson","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T10:18:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/05/Foreign/Images/05944451.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"MrpwzOkMSF+GrCcH48sCMA==\n"}

(Philip Ojisua/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNAIROBI — Eighty-two Chibok schoolgirls were released from Boko Haram insurgents on Saturday, according to Nigerian officials, a major development in the case of the Islamist group's most famous victims, the teenagers whose kidnapping inspired the #BringBackOurGirls movement.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, the girls were exchanged \"for some Boko Haram suspects held by the authorities,” according to a government statement. They are expected to be sent to Nigeria's capital on Sunday to meet the president.\n\nIn April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from a secondary school in the town of Chibok. That mass abduction turned the insurgent group, operating mostly in the country's northeast, into a household name across much of the world. Michelle Obama tweeted a picture of herself holding a placard with the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag.\n\nA few dozen of the schoolgirls escaped, but more than 200 remained in Boko Haram custody until last October, when 21 were released as part of a negotiation with the militants. Many wondered what had happened to the rest of the girls — whether they had been killed in a military operation, or forcibly married to fighters who would refuse to release them.\n\nSaturday's release of another 82 girls was joyous news for the town of Chibok, and also a victory for Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who had pledged again and again that he would locate and free the girls.\n\nIn spite of the focus on the Chibok schoolgirls, the group makes up only a tiny fraction of the thousands of people abducted by Boko Haram. In Damasak, on the Nigeria-Niger border, roughly 500 children are still missing, but they have received almost no attention within Nigeria or internationally. In many other towns and cities, hundreds more are still missing. Some 1.8 million people are now displaced across northeastern Nigeria due to the conflict, many of them living in near-famine conditions.\n\n[The growing horror in a city where 500 children were kidnapped by Boko Haram]\n\nThe Nigerian government has declared victory in the fight against Boko Haram, but the group continues to operate in many rural parts of the country's northeast. Borno State, where the bulk of the fight has occurred, is the size of Belgium, and includes vast tracts of forest, making it difficult to locate fighters — or their hostages — by air. The group has split into factions, with one of them maintaining ties to the Islamic State.\n\nIt is not clear which Boko Haram suspects were released in exchange for the girls. Insurgents have for more than a year been trying to use the girls as leverage for a prisoner exchange. In a video released last year, some of the kidnapped girls were shown pleading with the government to begin negotiations.\n\nThe government's statement thanked the government of Switzerland and the International Committee of the Red Cross for their role in the operation.\n\nRead more\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":"Kevin Sieff, Kevin Sieff","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T12:58:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/06/Foreign/Images/2017-05-06T215511Z_1322032319_RC12ADB27680_RTRMADP_3_NIGERIA-SECURITY.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"kEe5zpTCICbc4Jy9lWs7kw==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"590ec4529e4da44e45465340"},"description":"‘These ideas are not necessarily for the public good’","title":"Flying taxis or futuristic tunnels won’t save us from the misery of traffic","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/6/15518040/elon-musk-boring-company-uber-flying-car-public-transportation","text":"When you’re stuck in a traffic jam — and let’s face it, most of us are these days — do you dream of escaping by flying through the clouds or tunneling below the street? Soon enough, both options may become possible, thanks to a couple of high-concept ideas floating around Silicon Valley. But those who think they can transcend traffic in a flying taxi or through a futuristic, underground tunnel may be depressed to learn that neither plan is likely to do much to loosen the vise-like grip of traffic congestion on our nation’s roadways. In fact, they may actually make things worse.\n\nFirst, some facts: the US is the most congested developed country in the world, with 11 cities in the top 25 for most gridlocked. Drivers in the US spend an average of 42 hours a year in traffic during peak times, according to a recent analysis. And congestion costs more than just your time — it also hits you right in the wallet. The direct and indirect costs of gridlock in 2016 was $300 billion, or an average of $1,400 per driver.\n\ntraffic is literally killing us — our bodies and our souls\n\nTraffic is also extremely deadly. As many as 40,000 people died in motor vehicle crashes last year, according to the National Safety Council. That marks a 6 percent increase over 2015, and a 14 percent increase over 2014 — the most dramatic two-year escalation in 53 years.\n\nSo who can blame Silicon Valley for thinking this is a problem ripe for disruption. Tech evangelists preach the idea of saving the world. And if traffic is literally killing us — our bodies and our souls — why shouldn’t we look to these heroic engineers and coders for our salvation?\n\nProbably because its mostly bullshit. Sure, the technology exists. We’ve been digging tunnels since the late 19th century to bypass our choked surface streets. And the idea of vertical take-off and landing aircraft, which is what has Uber so jazzed these days, is still in its infancy, but experts agree could be due for a breakthrough. These are not new ideas. But when you start to look below the surface, it becomes clear that they’re not designed to benefit most of us who experience the daily torture of traffic. Just the people who can afford it.\n\n“these ideas are not necessarily for the public good.”\n\n“I have no doubt the technology will be there,” said “Gridlock” Sam Schwartz, a former New York City traffic commissioner and engineering consultant. “But again I come back to the very basic point, these ideas are not necessarily for the public good. It’s going to be good for a certain class of people, the ones that are in their limousines stuck in traffic behind a thousand Ubers and Lyfts.”\n\nBy his own account, Elon Musk comes up with his best ideas while stuck in Los Angeles’ infamous traffic jams. In 2012, he hatched the idea for the hyperloop — levitating capsules traveling at near supersonic speeds through airless tubes — when he was trapped in a particularly frustrating choke point. And more recently, another LA snarl-up (the city has a lot of them) caused him to cook up his latest crackpot scheme: a futuristic network of superhighways built underneath the nation’s congested urban centers.\n\nThe Boring Company, as he calls it, aims to revolutionize the laborious, expensive act of digging tunnels. And most importantly, Musk says he’s working on tunnel-boring machines than can simultaneously dig up and reinforce tunnels, which could go a long way toward solving a big engineering challenge.\n\nA few days before Musk sent his army of fanboys into a tizzy with a CGI video of Teslas careening on high-speed electric sleds through underground tunnels, Uber was tickling our utopian fancies with a different vision. At a conference in Dallas in late April, the embattled ride-sharing company unveiled its plan to launch an “on-demand aviation” service using small, electric-powered aircraft that can take off and land vertically. Two cities — Dallas-Forth Worth and Dubai — would play host to the first-of-its-kind service. And a handful of aircraft manufacturers and real estate developers would serve as Uber’s advance team in its early explorations of a flying taxi service. Yep, Uber is working on “flying cars” (and I use that term with extreme skepticism).\n\nEveryone not completely distracted by the current horror show in our nation’s capital probably caught both of these stories out of the corner of their eye and thought “Cool.” But what they’re missing is the subtext: our streets are in such poor shape the only innovations worth pursuing are ones that completely abandon the surface. We must become skylarks, or mole people, if we’re to get around in a stress-free manner. Ignoring the obviously enormous costs associated with both flying taxis and high-speed tunnels for a moment, there’s a strain of Silicon Valley thinking that assumes our most intractable problems can be solved by something glossy, mobile, and wrapped in carbon fiber. And that’s stupid.\n\n“The Silicon Valley approach to congestion seems to suffer from two of its chronic ills.”\n\n“The Silicon Valley approach to congestion seems to suffer from two of its chronic ills,” said Tom Vanderbilt, author of Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do. “The 'there's an app for that' thinking that often leads to solutions to non-existent problems — Segway was an early example of this — and the question of scaling. Is there anyone, apart from time-pressed one percenters, looking for a helicopter to whisk them, Sao Paolo style, across the dystopian transportation network below?”\n\nAt Uber’s flying taxi conference in Dallas, I posed this exact question to Mark Moore, a former NASA engineer who now serves as Uber’s guru for vertical take-off and landing aircraft. Who is this for exactly? What problem does this proposal even solve?\n\n“Gridlock!” he exclaimed. “Come on, you’ve experienced it. The highways are stuck. And project that out, 10 to 20 years.” He rattled off a lot of insidery lingo about “minimum infrastructure” and the ability to “co-locate” launchpads where people work and live, before landing on a crucial point.\n\n“We can handle the short distance trips really well with Uber,” Moore said. “When we have to travel far, we’re stuck on the ground like everyone else. So this new transportation system provides a way to rise above pathway dependent systems. It just has different vertiport nodes, with no infrastructure required between those nodes. And that’s a fundamental change in the architecture to be able to permit this very dynamic, very rapid type of travel that doesn’t take 20 years to put in place, like highways or light rail, or billions in bonds. By going up in the air, we can be faster than any other mode of transportation.”\n\n“By going up in the air, we can be faster than any other mode of transportation.”\n\nIt’s certainly true, surface-level transportation is a heavy lift, both in terms of construction and funding. But it is also true that cheaper, lightweight ideas like bike-share programs can go a long way toward improving the quality of life in our cities. But bikes aren’t as cool as flying taxis. Maybe Larry Page, the Google founder who is also working on a vertical take-off and landing aircraft, can bridge that gap: his Kitty Hawk project resembles a hoverbike more than a helicopter.\n\nVanderbilt, who also wrote the more recent book You May Also Like: Taste in an Era of Endless Choice, noted that in just about any test that's ever been run in New York City, the bicycle outperforms all other modes of transportation at peak periods — “yet we continue to not take it seriously as a transportation option by giving it substandard infrastructure.”\n\nBecause isn’t there the hint of the suggestion in both Musk and Uber’s proposals that other, proven modes of transportation — bikes, buses, trains, and subways — aren’t worth improving? Or that our cities aren’t worth redesigning to take away space from cars? If anything, they represent a direct rejection of the kind of egalitarianism inherent in mass-transit systems, in favor of individual happiness and individual freedom of movement.\n\n“individual optimality does not always equal system optimality.”\n\n“One lesson traffic engineers stress all the time is individual optimality does not always equal system optimality,” Vanderbilt said, “and there's a certain aspect of Silicon Valley culture that is certainly about optimizing one's own individual life — paying someone to wait in line for your burrito for you — without considering larger system effects (e.g., delivery app drivers parking by the fire hydrant to run in and grab those burritos).”\n\nSome tech firms have attempted to build a better transit service. Boston-based Bridj thought it could Uber-ize bus service by building a cool app and buying a fleet of commuter vans. The company was operating its on-demand bus service in San Francisco, Austin, Kansas City, and Boston when, earlier this month, it announced it would be shutting down. A major investment deal with an unnamed car company had collapsed, and the startup couldn’t see a path forward. And as reported by CityLab, many of the users happened to be young and wealthy, raising the question whether Bridj was serving the low-income populations it claimed it wanted to help.\n\nIt’s easy to get distracted by the flops, like Bridj, or the shiny objects, like flying Ubers, tunnels, self-driving cars, and hyperloops. The federal government has almost completely abandoned the idea that public transportation is worth subsidizing, preferring to pour money into car-friendly projects like wider highways and toll roads. And our cities get caught up in the hype, hitching their wagon to unproven concepts in the slim hope that their sleek-suited pitchmen can rescue them from the ills of choked highways and snarled city streets.\n\nRobert Puentes, president and CEO of the Eno Center for Transportation, noted that relatively small-bore interventions to improve the way we get around get lost when shiny proposals for flying cars or the hyperloop or the underground high-speed tunnels proliferate.\n\n“But I do think they’re still the same side of the coin,” Puentes said. “Yes, projects like hyperloop are fanciful at this stage and it does get frustrating to focus on those kinds of investments when there is such a dire need to get these investments up to state of good repair. But to the extent that these kinds of creative exercises help promote innovation in the transportation sector, I’m all for it. The challenge is to not get distracted.”","author":"Andrew J.

They just go because it’s a ‘must.’”\n\nThis man isn’t alone in his skepticism. Recent reports from the National Endowment for the Arts recorded an eight percent drop in the number of US adults who visited art museums in the past two decades, as well as a particularly sharp decline in museum-going rates among millennials in their twenties and thirties. In response to the findings, Sunil Iyengar, director of research and analysis at the NEA, told Pacific Standard in 2015 that “there’s no tidy answer as to why this is happening,” but added that “there’s a lot of competition for leisure activities.”\n\nMuseums must find new ways to engage and excite visitors. The growing slew of digital entertainment options wrestling for our attention may be part of the problem for museums, but for many institutions, digital technology also offers a potential solution. Charged with the crucial task of preserving our past, museums must now navigate the future.\n\nMuseums of Today\n\nCatherine Devine, chief digital officer at the American Museum of Natural History, sees the task at hand as “keeping the museum relevant for a number of different audiences,” and she has spent the past five years working “to really get [the museum] into the 21st century.” That means rethinking the way visitors experience museums to better match the way they lead their daily lives, where tasks as varied as ordering food or finding a date can be accomplished with just a click or a swipe.\n\nVisitors expect their digital experiences to follow them into the museum\n\n“A lot of people’s expectations are framed in the rest of their lives, and then when they come to the museum, […] they expect that experience to continue,” Devine says.\n\nOne step in that direction has been the launch and ensuing redesign of the museum’s smartphone app, called Explorer. Originally developed in 2010, the museum officially relaunched the app last November, filled with reimagined content like behind-the-scenes trivia and virtual games. When I open Explorer inside the Hall of Ocean Life—where the museum’s famous 94-foot-long model of a blue whale presides—the app promptly informs me that a blue whale weighs as much as five subway cars, and lets me listen to an underwater recording of whale songs.\n\nThe app uses a network of 800 beacons placed throughout the museum to pinpoint visitors’ locations and show content related to your immediate surroundings, as well as provide relevant logistical information, like directions. According to Scott Rohan, the museum’s senior publicist, Explorer has been downloaded more than a million times since July 2010.\n\nIn nearly two decades working at the American Museum of Natural History, Vivian Trakinski, director of the museum’s Science Bulletins, has witnessed the evolution of visitor experiences firsthand. Originally hired to produce short science documentaries, Trakinski now spends most of her time working on data visualizations in a variety of digital formats.\n\n“When I came here [in 1999], we were focused on video,” she says. She still produces videos, but says that “now, we are focusing on more immersive and interactive platforms [...] People want to be able to curate their own content. People want to be engaged in the creation of it.”\n\nTrakinski’s team is currently working on a number of augmented reality prototypes that will allow visitors to more actively engage with the museum’s specimens and datasets, including an immersive AR experience of what it would be like to play golf on Mars, using data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s Context Camera. Her team also took a CT scan of a Mako shark and created an AR experience in which visitors can look through a Google Tango tablet or a stereoscopic AR headset, see the scanned skeleton overlaid on top of the museum’s actual shark model, and make the shark swim or bite.\n\n“It’s not a passive experience where we’re telling you something,” says Trakinski. “[Visitors] are actually creating the learning through the interaction with this real artifact of science.”\n\nAs the Museum of Natural History tests out its AR prototypes, just a few miles uptown at the Met Cloisters, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has collaborated with several institutions to produce its own experiment with virtual reality. This spring, the Met launched an exhibit “Small Wonders: The VR Experience,” inviting visitors to don a VR headset and explore the detailing on a 16th century Gothic prayer bead up close. Lisa Ellis, a conservator at the Art Gallery of Ontario, spearheaded the original micro-CT scanning of the miniature beads. She recalls that her team was “blown away” when they saw the intricacies of the beads’ designs and wanted to share them with a wider audience. The immersive experience provided by the HTC Vive headset was “the perfect vehicle for this object.”\n\nImmersion and interaction are also key elements in the visitor experience at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. The museum reopened in late 2014 after a three-year renovation. (Check out The Verge’s 2015 interview with the museum’s former head of engineering here.) Technological upgrades included the introduction of an electronic Pen that allows visitors to draw on digital display tables and to download and save items throughout the museum to a personal web account linked to their Pen.\n\nCaroline Baumann, the director of Cooper Hewitt, recalls that the museum confronted many skeptics when first floating the concept of the electronic stylus, with some critics assuming that no visitors would put down their smartphone for long enough to use the Pen. Today, she proudly notes that 97 percent of visitors actually take the Pen upon entering the gallery and that 21 million objects have been downloaded to visitors’ accounts using the gadget. Baumann hoped that the tool would be accessible to all and would “cut across education, class, privilege,” and she believes that the digital redesign of the museum has succeeded in drawing both museum connoisseurs and first-timers. “We’re seeing people that have never been to a museum,” she says.\n\nHigh-Tech Success\n\nFor many institutions, the digital revolution has required a complete rethinking of the museum model and a new digital mindset that filters through the entire operation.\n\n“I feel that digital is not something that sits to the side,” says Devine. “It has to be really integrated into the physical experience. It has to augment it and add a layer that you don’t have with the physical space.”\n\nThe shift to digital is beginning to permeate museum culture\n\nPamela Horn, acting director of digital and emerging media at Cooper Hewitt, acknowledges the pervasive change that has taken shape since the museum’s digital revamp. “Something very interesting has been happening in the last three years since we have reopened, and that’s that we've had an internal cultural shift of everybody adapting to this way of working,” she reflects. “Digital isn't just an appendage on top, it has infiltrated all of the departments.”\n\nAnd so far, museum leaders are pleased with the results.\n\nThough Devine does not believe that the Explorer app on its own is responsible for attracting more visitors, she says that the museum’s research on the app’s effectiveness revealed that visitors who used the app “found the whole museum experience more thought-provoking,” on average, than those who did not use the app.\n\nEllis similarly cites internal research which found that 90 percent of people who used the VR headset to explore the prayer bead at the Met thought it was “highly successful” (including a group of visiting nuns who reportedly “got a big kick out of it”). Perhaps most striking of all, Horn notes that Cooper Hewitt’s digital redesign has attracted younger visitors at a time when the coveted demographic seems to have reduced its museum attendance overall. Before the museum closed for renovations in 2011, the average age of Cooper Hewitt visitors hovered around 60 years old. After its reopening in December 2014, the average age has dropped precipitously to 27.\n\nBut success like this requires significant commitment.\n\n“The key is having a digital person as part of the senior management team and a digital team that’s really, really strong,” says Baumann. “And a funder.”\n\nFinancing these projects is a crucial challenge, and many of the museums have relied on outside donations to fund their experiments. Support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, for example, facilitated both the Cooper Hewitt renovations and the development of the Museum of Natural History’s Explorer app.\n\nMuseum staff also emphasized the necessary balance between embracing the digital and preserving the analog features of museums.\n\n“We are the museum of the future. Despite being in [Andrew] Carnegie’s mansion, which was built in 1899, finished in 1902, you come in and you know immediately that it’s a digital experience,” Baumann explains. Still, her team had to be careful not to overdo it: “We didn’t want to put digital all over the walls, ceiling, ground.” The fifteen new tables with touch-screen digital displays are scattered spaciously throughout the museum’s multiple floors.\n\nTechnology should serve to enhance a visitor’s understanding of a museum’s collection\n\nFor Ellis, the original artifacts must remain a priority, and technology should serve to enhance the visitor’s understanding of the physical objects. With the 16th century prayer beads, “you get in [the VR headset] and you’re just blown away,” she says, leading many visitors to return for a second look at the art in person.\n\n“Our primary focus is bringing people to the art and giving them access to the art, so we would only use a technology that allowed us to do that,” she adds. “We’re not in it for the bells and the whistles or to show off.”\n\nMuseums of Tomorrow\n\nMuseum leaders expect upcoming years to bring a number of changes, including deeper immersion, more communal creation, and greater personalization.\n\nDevine predicts that in a few years we will see a shift away from smartphone-focused tech and towards more wearables and updated versions of smart glasses. Though museums like the Met have already experimented with forays into virtual reality, Devine says she’s excited about future experiences that will likely immerse all of the senses.\n\nBaumann cautions, however, that technologies like VR and AR are changing so rapidly that it is hard to know how museums will eventually take advantage of their capabilities. “Where are we going to be six months from now?” she asks. “I don’t want to unveil something unless it’s right-on.”\n\nFor Trakinski and her work on data visualization, the future revolves around “communal creativity,” like open source projects that elicit involvement from partner institutions and outside developers. She cites the Museum of Natural History’s current involvement in the NASA-funded project OpenSpace—an open source data visualization software to communicate space exploration to the general public—as an example of a growing movement.\n\n“I think sharing resources, sharing knowledge, open source software development, customization, [and] using common tools is something of a trend that I would see driving all of our work forward in a communal context,” she says.\n\nThe Met has similarly chosen to share more of its resources and encourage communal creativity. In February, the museum released a collection of more than 375,000 images for public use under a Creative Commons license.\n\n“How can we take one physical space and present it differently to different people?”\n\nOne element receives nearly unanimous support from museum leaders: personalizing the experiences of future museum-goers. Devine adds that such customization is one of the key opportunities of digital technology, allowing designers to ask, “How can we take one physical space and present it differently to different people?”\n\nShe expects that future iterations of the Explorer app will feature multiple languages and new capacities to promote relevant content based on the time of day, like where to find an afternoon coffee or how to exit the building after 5 p.m. “The idea is to try and anticipate what you need in that moment—and then that’s different for different people—and then provide that to you without you having to navigate to it,” she explains.\n\nShe also envisions personalization of the museum’s website, where different visitors will see different content: Museum members wouldn’t need to be shown information on how to become a member, mobile visitors in New York might see ticketing services first, and teachers would find educational materials upfront.\n\nBaumann likewise reflects on her goals for a customizable future. She thinks about a group of visitors surrounding one of the digital tables, each drawing or researching individually with their Pens, and “would love it if a 7-year-old can have his experience, and then the Pratt student studying industrial design can have a slightly more advanced experience.”\n\nThe most popular spot in the Cooper Hewitt museum is the second-floor Immersion Room. Inside, two of the walls are covered by giant screens where a variety of patterns and wallpapers flash on rotation. Using the touch-screen table in the center of the room, visitors can choose their preferred wall décor from among several hundred samples shown on the screen, or they can use their electronic pen to draw their own design and then project it all around them. The same space can be uniquely personalized based on individual taste.\n\nThe future of museums sounds a lot like the Immersion Room, as a single museum may eventually provide customized experiences for each person who enters. “Knowing the digital platforms that exist out there,” Baumann says, “the opportunity is huge.”","author":"Nikki Erlick","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T16:00:01.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Anwy2lvuce0AVtsN-QPXj71mVo=/0x93:1803x1107/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54653095/Small_Wonders_VR_2_Met_Cloisters_Photo_by_Michael_Blase.0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"G05mlMTtoRd+2vzuioWGVQ==\n"}

I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're a fan.\n\nI never quite got hooked on the mysteries of Sense8’s first season, but what I did love about it was how it felt like such a pure distillation of the Wachowskis' interests: from martial arts to shared bodies and minds to larger-than-life forces keeping people from living the lives they want for themselves. The show has so many characters and locations and styles, it's kind of incredible they're able to stitch it all together.\n\nCheck out 11 trailers from this week below.\n\nThe Dark Tower\n\nThe long-in-the-works adaptation of Stephen King’s The Dark Tower is almost here, and this week we got a first look at it. The film looks appropriately epic for a world-spanning story featuring gunfights and magic. But the film’s backstory is pretty involved — the series spans eight books, and this movie seems like it might be both a sequel and an adaptation — so I’d recommend checking out my colleague Andrew Liptak’s explanation of exactly what’s going on if you’re at all interested. The film comes out August 4th.\n\nMarvel’s The Defenders\n\nAfter years of planning, Netflix's four Marvel series are all coming together. The Defenders puts Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist into a superhero supergroup for an eight-episode series that's pretty much bound to be a hit. There's lots of action. Lots of jokes. And of course, a hallway fight. It comes out August 18th.\n\nDunkirk\n\nThis new look at Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk gets us right up close with its characters, and yet, the whole thing feels surprisingly lonely. The movie seems to treat people, ships, and planes like pieces in a chess game — and that makes this trailer pretty tense for just a two-minute clip. The film comes out July 21st.\n\nHouse of Cards\n\nIn case the past year's actual politics hasn't been horrifying enough for you, Netflix is back with a new season of House of Cards. Something about Frank's “I know what's best” speech here feels oddly familiar. The series returns May 30th.\n\nThe Big Sick\n\nSilicon Valley's Kumail Nanjiani stars in this romantic comedy that seems to twist free of the genre's tropes with a focus on the culture clash that happens when Nanjiani falls for a woman and bucks his parents’ plans for an arranged marriage. It comes out June 23rd.\n\nIt Comes at Night\n\nA24 keeps picking up offbeat but extremely creepy horror films. Last year it had The Witch. And this year, it has It Comes at Night. The movie looks claustrophobic, mysterious, and also just beautifully shot. It comes out June 9th.\n\nWhose Streets?\n\nWhose Streets? documents the people of Ferguson, Missouri, and the protests that followed the police shooting of Michael Brown. The film got some great reviews at Sundance, and it's easy to see why: it looks like a surprisingly intimate and raw portrait of a community coming together amid a crisis. It comes out August 11th.\n\nThe Woman Who Left\n\nThis movie has a ridiculous 3-hour, 47-minute run time, but it really does look intriguing. The Woman Who Left is about a woman who’s released from jail after 30 years when she's finally cleared of committing a murder, and thus far, reviews have said it's a great watch if you're willing to put in the time. The film comes to the US on May 19th in limited release.\n\n5-25-77\n\nAfter more than a decade in production, director Patrick Read Johnson's film inspired by his own childhood and fandom for Star Wars is finally coming out. The conceit behind this movie is entirely ridiculous, and I also find it impossible to take a movie seriously when its lead actor looks like a young Julian Casablancas. But it seems funny in a Napoleon Dynamite kind of way, and there's no question others out there will relate to Johnson's passion for Star Wars. The film comes out May 25th — or, you know, 5-27-17.\n\nAbacus: Small Enough to Jail\n\nPBS has a really interesting-looking documentary about Abacus Federal Savings Bank, the only bank brought to trial after the financial crisis. It's another story that seems to expose the ludicrous nature of the banking system and its regulators, but in doing so, the film also steps into the small immigrant community the bank popped up to serve. The documentary comes out May 19th.\n\nKill Switch\n\nI'm always very skeptical of movies shot in the first person, and Kill Switch, the latest, really seems to be playing up its video game roots. There's not a lot to see in this teaser, but first-person movies like this are still few and far enough between that it seems worth checking out. The film comes out June 16th.","author":"Jacob Kastrenakes","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T15:00:02.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foVni-yTF8Ll-kb_rCOcma_8998=/0x0:1606x903/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54652523/gallery_photo_2.0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"Ns3TuVTvhlM1aUFWvDDL7Q==\n"}

In the lead-up to the release of the Switch, Nintendo said its new portable hardware and its old handhelds would coexist. But as the Switch became Nintendo’s fastest-selling console, many wondered if the 3DS and the 2DS would gradually make their way toward the sunset. That isn’t the case.\n\nLet’s temporarily put aside questions of Nintendo cannibalizing the handheld market. The New 2DS XL may be the best handheld hardware Nintendo has made since the original DS in 2004.\n\nDespite the 2DS branding, the New 2DS XL bears a much stronger resemblance to the New 3DS XL than it does to the original budget 2DS. In fact, from an internal hardware perspective, the New 2DS XL is essentially a New 3DS XL: it features the same faster and more powerful processor; the same large screens; NFC support for Amiibo; a full set of Nintendo’s L, R, ZL, and ZR shoulder buttons; and a C stick. Instead of the awkward wedge shape of the 2DS, the New 2DS XL features a clamshell design similar to every other member of the DS and 3DS line.\n\nThe biggest difference between the New 2DS XL and the New 3DS XL is in the name: the New 2DS ditches the stereoscopic 3D gimmick of the 3DS entirely, opting for standard two-dimensional displays. The trade-off is in the price — at $149.99, the New 2DS costs $50 less than the $199.99 New 3DS XL.\n\nIndustry-wide, 3D gaming has failed to catch on. So the 2DS will be, for many, an improved version of the product at a lower cost. This may mark the end of Nintendo’s interest in its experiment with glasses-free 3D. Two-thirds of the current 3DS line now consists of more traditional 2D screens — and recent releases like Pokémon Sun and Moon didn’t even support the 3D feature.\n\nThere are other benefits to ditching 3D. The screen half of the device is notably smaller and thinner, presumably by cutting out the 3D hardware. (The front-facing camera remains but it moved to the center of the hinge. Ditto the dual cameras — those have been moved to the bottom half of the portable near the shoulder buttons.) The plastic is a sturdy matte similar to the Switch, the top of the case has a great tactile striped texture, and the shiny bright blue accents make it easy to flip the screen open.\n\nThe New 2DS XL also improves on the New 3DS design in a couple of ways. In addition to the smaller design, the microSD card slot has been moved to alongside the cartridge, meaning you no longer have to remove the back to add more space. And unlike the New 3DS models, Nintendo says the New 2DS will come with a charger.\n\nMy one misgiving about the device is the hinge, which can be adjusted between three positions: one at a right angle, one completely flat, and one somewhere in between. But each of the positions has a little give to it that can cause the screen to wobble when moved around. I know, small problem.\n\nWith the Switch now available, the New 2DS XL reminds me of the Game Boy Micro. Nintendo’s swan song for the Game Boy Advanced line had incredible hardware, and was ultimately eclipsed by the DS. But even if Nintendo decides to stop giving attention to the 3DS line of products and slows its pace of new games, the 2DS XL will still be the best way to catch up on the incredible back catalog for the handheld device. There may come a time when Nintendo focuses its efforts on the Switch, but right now, the 2DS XL is a nice alternative for handheld fans at half the price of its sibling and with hundreds more games.\n\nThe 3DS had a difficult launch, taking years to find its audience. But Nintendo learned from the process. The New 2DS shows the company doesn’t need to double down on gimmicks — this is the best 3DS the company has made yet, and it doesn’t have 3D.\n\nUpdate: Clarified the camera placement","author":"Chaim Gartenberg","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T14:00:02.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dQ8tsMUCjEGKfrtKQVY_whakJ00=/0x106:2040x1254/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54629323/rmiller_170503_1665_0009.0.1493992571.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"ONUI/YDcsTKZS2jTp2aFmA==\n"}

According to The Hill, the Federal Communications Commission has opened an investigation into Colbert’s comments to see if the joke, which illustrated a sexual act between the president and Vladimir Putin using the word “cock,” meets the Supreme Court standards for “obscene” content. Colbert half-heartedly apologized for the joke on Wednesday, saying his words were “cruder” than they needed to be following the #FireColbert boycott that spun up on Twitter in the aftermath.\n\nColbert could be fined for the language of his Trump insult\n\nThe FCC, beyond its current role as the imminent destroyer of net neutrality regulations, is also tasked with policing speech on US television. The organization is bound by the rules of the Supreme Court set out in the landmark 1978 case, FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, which established the agency’s power over “indecent” and “obscene” broadcasting. The case also established the “seven dirty words” doctrine, which laid out the swear words you cannot say on television in excess for fear of being fined by the FCC. One of those original words happens to be “cock sucker.” In Colbert's monologue he said, \"The only thing [Trump's] mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin's cock holster.”\n\nThere are byzantine rules that define how something like this is handled administratively. For instance, if the broadcast is prior to 10PM ET, it must only meet the loose standard of “indecent,” which typically involves use of any harsh language, violence, nudity, and things of that nature. After 10PM ET, when Colbert’s show airs, the questionable content must be found “obscene.”\n\nThese are of course nebulous concepts subject to the ever-changing moral standards of modern society. Nonetheless, the FCC received a number of complaints regarding Colbert’s joke and is exploring whether to hand down a fine. Typically, regulators are bound by the Miller Test, established by the 1973 Supreme Court case Miller v. California, that created a three-tier test to determine if something can be considered obscene. So even though Colbert didn’t use one of the seven dirty words excessively, he still could be found in violation of the Miller Test for having described a sexual act in a way that “lacked serious artistic, literary, political, or scientific value.”\n\n“We are going to take the facts that we find and we are going to apply the law as it’s been set out by the Supreme Court and other courts and we’ll take the appropriate action,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai told Talk Radio 1210 WPHT on Thursday, according to The Hill. “Traditionally, the agency has to decide, if it does find a violation, what the appropriate remedy should be. A fine, of some sort, is typically what we do.”","author":"Nick Statt","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T22:31:27.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2MizMCAIolOV8Cwv_wiP_FQ1UM=/7x0:846x472/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54648741/stephen_colbert_1.0.png","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"++J+NShxdqK5N79F4u4HxQ==\n"}

Before a purge of such accounts last month, USA Today contends that spam accounts made up a significant percentage of the publication’s followers on the social media platform.\n\nWhile the social media company recently stepped up its efforts to combat fake accounts by purging millions of fake accounts in April, Gannett has gone to the FBI, saying that it remains a target of these types of spam efforts. It’s not immediately clear if the agency will investigate. While fake accounts violate Facebook’s Terms of Service, doing so isn’t a crime, but the company notes that these types of accounts “risks damaging a publisher's brand.”\n\nFacebook told USA Today on Friday that it had “detected additional suspicious activity since its April fake-account crackdown,” and that it is working to take action against them. The media company says that it has taken steps to block such accounts by deploying software to delete spam accounts, and has barring new followers from Bangladesh, where some of the spam activity has originated. According to the paper, there’s no “no indication of a security risk to legitimate followers” of its Facebook page.\n\nMore than a third of USA Today’s Facebook followers were purged in April\n\nGannett claims that Facebook’s purge of fake accounts in April “included more than a third of USA Today’s approximately 15.2 million Facebook ‘likes’ at the time,” and Facebook informed the company that it could purge an additional three million accounts soon. The page currently has 9.5 million likes on Facebook, and the company has seen no dip in referrals since the fake accounts were purged.\n\nIn April, Facebook announced that it shut down a network of spam accounts as part of a larger campaign to shut down fake accounts. This network created what Facebook called “inauthentic accounts”, which in turn liked publisher pages, with the intention of spreading spam to users or distributed false information. USA Today says that it’s not sure why it’s been singled out by spammers, but it notes that media pages are frequently targeted because they post more often, allowing spammers to quickly build up a profile that looks more like a legitimate account.\n\nWe’ve reached out to the FBI, Facebook, and USA Today for comment, and will update this post if we hear back.","author":"Andrew Liptak","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T20:32:30.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yu0_o3YcW0skG0yGvU1BHuD43N4=/0x145:3000x1833/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54655973/453219740.0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"T983i5zMbVchHjDXa0J64w==\n"}

In a statement to the BBC, the Macron campaign said it had been the victim of a “massive hacking attack” and confirmed that some of the documents were taken from campaign officials, although it claimed other portions of the archive may be fabricated.\n\nThe attack is conspicuously similar to a string of hacks against the Clinton campaign during the US election last year. In April, independent researchers detected a phishing attack against the Macron campaign, although the campaign insisted that no data had been compromised by the attack. The techniques showed significant technical similarities to the hacks against the Democratic National Committee, which US intelligence agencies attributed to an active intelligence campaign by the Russian government, directly ordered by President Vladimir Putin. In both elections, the attacks targeted the candidate less favorable towards the Russian president.\n\nFrench election law prevents domestic outlets from reporting on election-related issues until polls have closed. Nonetheless, the files have circulated widely among LePen supporters on 4chan’s /pol/ board after being posted to Pastebin earlier today. Pastebin has since removed the post itself, although archived versions remain.\n\nFrance’s presidential election is set to conclude on Sunday, with Macron facing off against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.

A new, minimalist phone is designed for people want to eliminate all that clutter, but still remain reachable.\n\nThe size of a credit card, The Light Phone is about as stripped down as one can get: it can receive and make calls, store up to nine numbers, and tell the time. That’s it. No texting, e-mail, or anything else. This also isn’t a bluetooth accessory that pairs to a smartphone: users open an account and install an app on their existing smartphone, which forwards calls to and from the device. It also means that users don’t need to worry about maintaining a second number.\n\nThe Light Phone has an unlocked SIM card, and operates on a 2G GSM network (users will need to pay five dollars a month for service).

He posted his process on Instructables, noting that he made the board out walnut, soft maple, and Jatoba wood, which he measured out and cut to exact dimensions and glued onto eight octagonal rings. Each space has a magnet embedded in it, and once he glued each side together, he used a lathe to turn it into a sphere.\n\nThe magnets allow players to move their pieces all over the globe, even upside down. Myers told Make Magazine that he was surprised at how the game changed with the board as a globe: he thought “that the rooks would be more powerful because a spherical board lacked vertical edges. I was proven wrong very quickly. Without the side edges of the board, the bishops became very deadly,” The curved surface also provides players with an added level of complexity, as they can’t see all the pieces at the same time.","author":"Andrew Liptak","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T19:00:01.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TwHR7kWSoNmCziSil1mMMXr1gnA=/0x36:1688x920/fit-in/1200x630/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8474471/Screen_Shot_2017_05_06_at_1.01.30_PM.png","class":"Technology","digest":"URrB1s5sqFI+nrWN7cRoGg==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"590ec4599e4da44e4546535f"},"description":"The House’s passage of the bill led to an outcry from the health care industry and consumer groups, which found an uncommon ally in some insurers.","title":"In Rare Unity, Hospitals, Doctors and Insurers Criticize Health Bill","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/health/health-care-bill-criticisms.html","text":"Others were even more direct about the effects the bill would have, not only on patients but also on the industry. “To me, this is not a reform,” said Michael J. Dowling, the chief executive of Northwell Health, a large health system in New York. “This is just a debacle.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHospitals that serve low-income patients “will just be drowning completely when this happens,” Mr. Dowling said, noting that more people would become uninsured at the same time that government payments to cover their costs were reduced.\n\nIn contrast to hospital and doctor groups, insurers had largely remained silent about their reservations, perhaps in the hopes of bartering their low profile in exchange for assurances that billions of dollars in subsidies for low-income coverage would continue. The White House and Congress have gone back and forth about their willingness to pay for the subsidies, prompting anxiety among some companies. Several, including Anthem, have threatened to sharply raise their prices or leave markets altogether without the funding.\n\nBut a few, including Blue Shield of California, came out in opposition to the bill before the vote. “We feel compelled to oppose it,” said Paul Markovich, the company’s chief executive. “It raises the specter that the sickest and neediest among us will be disproportionately hit in losing access.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the House passed the bill on Thursday, the industry’s two major trade groups urged lawmakers to increase the tax credits available to help people pay for coverage, and to adjust them to assist those who are older, live in high-cost areas or have lower incomes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the overriding concern — for insurers, many workers and officials throughout the health care systems in many states — is the broad reductions proposed for Medicaid. Even for insurers that have largely abandoned the individual market, like UnitedHealth Group and Aetna, a substantial portion of their business is providing coverage under Medicaid. The same is true for many local nonprofit plans, said Ceci Connolly, the chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEmployers and others said they were also concerned about the effects on freelancers, who do not have a traditional employer but are self-employed or contract workers in the so-called gig economy.\n\nDepending on their income, those workers have shuttled between Medicaid and the individual insurance market under the federal health care law, which offered a greater level of stability, said Nell Abernathy, vice president for research and policy at the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning economic research organization.\n\n“A huge swath of Americans are in insecure work arrangements,” she said. “This repeals that level of security, which was not perfect, but it was a step in the right direction.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSmall businesses, which were sharply divided over the original law, remained mixed in their response to the Republican bill, and there seemed little doubt that some companies would drop coverage in the absence of any penalty. The National Federation of Independent Business, which opposed the Affordable Care Act, said the House legislation was “a crucial first step toward health care reform.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn other people’s view, employees of small businesses would lose out if Medicaid were rolled back or the exchanges became threadbare, because many smaller companies rely on employees’ ability to obtain coverage through the government program or individual market.\n\nThe Main Street Alliance, a group of small-business owners that supported the Affordable Care Act, said four million small-business owners, employees and self-employed entrepreneurs had gained insurance under the law, and that an additional six million small-business workers had signed up for Medicaid through the law’s expansion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“This bill leaves small-business owners in a terrible position, one they were all too familiar with before the A.C.A.: unable to afford premium hikes year to year, unsure their employees will be healthy and able to work, and uncertain of the future of their businesses,” said Amanda Ballantyne, national director of the Main Street Alliance.\n\nThe recent amendments to the bill also raised questions about coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions, which has become an emotional flash point for opposition. The bill would allow states to waive some of the current rules banning insurers from charging sick people more or excluding certain benefits, and those waivers could have broad effects if employers are no longer required to provide comprehensive coverage. Before the Affordable Care Act, many employers capped how much they would pay for care over a person’s lifetime at $2 million, said Tracy Watts, a senior partner at Mercer, a benefits consultant.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While half indicated that they were unlikely to reinstate lifetime limits, 15 percent said they would consider doing that.\n\nAnd employer groups generally favored provisions of the bill that would reduce taxes, particularly the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health plans, which was delayed for several years. Employers favor its overall repeal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome health care groups, like medical device manufacturers, supported the bill because of specific provisions like the repeal of a 2.3 percent device tax under the Affordable Care Act. That tax was suspended for two years in 2015, but the industry wants a permanent repeal. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry’s largest trade group, said it had not taken a position on the bill.\n\nUnlike doctors and hospitals, which would most likely experience an immediate hit if millions of Americans lost insurance, medical device manufacturers and the drug industry would probably feel a more muted effect. The drug industry, for example, might sell fewer products and lose revenue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Fewer patients are treated, so it’s bad for them, but it’s a lot worse for hospitals and the impact on physicians,” said Ronny Gal, an analyst for Bernstein who covers the drug industry. “They’re a little bit on the tail end of this.”","author":"Reed Abelson and Katie Thomas","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T23:18:57.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/05/us/05INSURE/05INSURE-facebookJumbo.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"BvkhlvDqdNzKmiGEEzNJWQ==\n"}

Untrapped\n\nTrainer: Steve Asmussen Jockey: Ricardo Santana Jr. Odds: 30-1\n\nDrape: He has one victory in six starts. It did occur at Churchill Downs. But no way he gets his second here Saturday.\n\nHoppert: Sixth in the Arkansas Derby, this colt is distance-challenged and has been trending downward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n5. Always Dreaming\n\nTrainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: John Velazquez Odds: 5-1\n\nDrape: The colt is deservedly among the favorites after a terrific Florida Derby and very strong workouts since. He has been hard to handle here, prompting a change of equipment and exercise riders by his trainer. Don’t blame you if you bet him big or throw him out altogether.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: He won the Florida Derby by an impressive five lengths.

State of Honor\n\nTrainer: Mark Casse Jockey: Jose Lezcano Odds: 30-1\n\nDrape: He has some early speed, and his pedigree suggests he will take to a wet track. The colt will be prominent early. Late? Not at all.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: The Florida Derby runner-up will likely go straight to the lead. He has been solid in the mornings here, but it is extremely doubtful that he can hang on to win.\n\n7.

Alas, he developed a foot problem and will run in a bar shoe to protect his hoof. That’s too much to overcome.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: The Louisiana Derby winner had lots of upside until his training schedule was thrown into disarray because of the aforementioned woes. Pass.\n\nPhoto\n\n8. Hence\n\nTrainer: Steve Asmussen Jockey: Florent Geroux Odds: 15-1\n\nDrape: He ran fast while winning the Sunland Derby, has won on a wet track and raced here last year to lose only by a neck. If that’s enough for you, bet him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: He has been lights out during training, setting the backfield abuzz and quickly establishing himself as the all-important “wiseguy pick.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n9. Irap\n\nTrainer: Doug O’Neill Jockey: Mario Gutierrez Odds: 20-1\n\nDrape: He won his first race a month ago. That ain’t the greatest foundation to capture America’s most famous race.\n\nHoppert: He did post a 31-1 upset in the Blue Grass, but the oddsmaker was being generous when he installed him at 20-1.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n10. Gunnevera\n\nTrainer: Antonio Sano Jockey: Javier Castellano Odds: 15-1\n\nDrape: He cost only $16,000 and is a hard-trying colt with four victories and more than $1 million in earnings. He is a closer, though, and needs the pace to collapse in front and a clear path to get to the wire first.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: The third-place finisher in the Florida Derby is — rightfully — getting sympathy votes: His mother died after foaling him, and his Venezuelan trainer has been kidnapped twice.\n\n11. Battle of Midway\n\nTrainer: Jerry Hollendorfer Jockey: Flavien Prat Odds: 30-1\n\nDrape: This lightly raced colt ran a solid second in the Santa Anita Derby. It’s hard, however, to see him hitting the board.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: He is improving and has front-end speed, but his connections prefer he ration his energy for the mile-and-a-quarter Derby.\n\n12.

He’s got speed and could be running at the end.\n\nPhoto\n\n14. Classic Empire\n\nTrainer: Mark Casse Jockey: Julien Leparoux Odds: 4-1\n\nDrape: He was the 2-year-old champion, the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile winner, and a horse for the course (2 for 2 at Churchill). Because of injuries, the colt has only raced twice as a 3-year-old – once in February and three weeks ago. He is not burning my money at a short price.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: Injuries aside, the Pioneerof the Nile colt has been the class of this mediocre 3-year-old crop, and his Arkansas Derby performance was enough to put me back on the bandwagon.\n\n15. McCraken\n\nTrainer: Ian Wilkes Jockey: Brian Hernandez Jr. Odds: 5-1\n\nDrape: He has won four of five and has worked like a machine here in the mornings. He is definitely a buzz horse, but I don’t think I’m going to listen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: His third-place finish in the Blue Grass was his first loss, but it came after he was sidelined with a minor shin injury. His trainer shook it off and said his colt will be ready for the Derby. Rain in the forecast only ups his game.\n\nPhoto\n\n16. Tapwrit\n\nTrainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Jose Ortiz Odds: 20-1\n\nDrape: Here’s your winner: This colt has quietly been growing into a racehorse in the shadow of his stablemate Always Dreaming. Excuse the Blue Grass, he blew the start. He’s won on a wet track and, yes Mom, he is gray.\n\nHoppert: I’m still scratching my head after this Tapit colt failed to fire in the Blue Grass, finishing a well-beaten fifth. But he has been a star during the morning hours, showcasing his fluid stride.\n\nPhoto\n\n17. Irish War Cry\n\nTrainer: Graham Motion Jockey: Rajiv Maragh Odds: 6-1\n\nDrape: Here’s your winner. I know I just said that, but value demands I take 20-1 over 6-1 every time. His trainer will understand — I correctly picked his Animal Kingdom (25-1) in 2011. So far, this colt has been the class of the crop.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: Of course Joe reminds us of his Animal Kingdom pick. But I agree with him on the Wood Memorial winner, who has tons of speed and feel-good stories aplenty, from his female owner who raced cars in Europe to his jockey who came back from serious injuries. But no horse has ever won from Post 17.\n\n18. Gormley\n\nTrainer: John Shirreffs Jockey: Victor Espinoza Odds: 15-1\n\nDrape: The trainer won this race in 2005 with Giacomo, and the jockey won in 2002 with War Emblem and 2014 with California Chrome; and he swept the Triple Crown in 2015 with American Pharoah. No surprise if they add to their résumés.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: The Santa Anita Derby winner is conditioned by Zenyatta’s old-school trainer. He will have him in good shape for this race, but will that be enough?\n\nPhoto\n\n19. Practical Joke\n\nTrainer: Chad Brown Jockey: Joel Rosario Odds: 20-1\n\nDrape: This guy was a gutsy 2-year-old, but everyone else developed, and he has not. At best, he is a miler. He has a lousy post to boot.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoppert: The runner-up in Blue Grass clearly has distance limitations, as he has lacked that finishing punch his past couple races. His trainer added blinkers when he got here, but then he took them off.\n\n20. Patch\n\nTrainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Tyler Gaffalione Odds: 30-1\n\nDrape: If the Louisiana Derby runner-up had a motor installed, this guy wouldn’t win.\n\nHoppert: That’s not nice! This lightly raced colt only has one eye, making him by far the fan favorite. But he will need a miracle coming from that far outside.","author":"Joe Drape and Melissa Hoppert","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T23:18:28.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/06/sports/tapwrit/tapwrit-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"c50z3jUnKf4gEOGtOnTb/Q==\n"}

In 2015, in what was then called the largest hazing prosecution in the nation, 22 former fraternity members at Northern Illinois University were convicted in connection with the death of a freshman, David Bogenberger.\n\nBut the Bogenberger case involved misdemeanor charges only. Those charged with involuntary manslaughter — a felony — in the death of Mr. Piazza also face felony charges of aggravated assault, which could result in prison terms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 70-page grand jury indictment was based in part on videotape from surveillance cameras inside the fraternity house that captured Mr. Piazza’s final hours, as well as text messages between the fraternity members. It revealed, in gruesome detail, a night of drunken partying that led to Mr. Piazza’s death.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe party, on Feb. 2, consisted of a pledge initiation ritual in which the fraternity pledges lined up for a “gauntlet” of drinking stations, the indictment said. First, they passed a vodka bottle down the line, requiring each pledge to drink from it, before moving onto the next station, where they were required to “shotgun” a beer, and then another, where they were made to drink from a “wine bag,” before descending to the basement to play beer pong.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt about 10:40 p.m., Mr. Piazza was spotted, obviously drunk, “staggering, while hunched over.” He was helped to a couch by one of the fraternity brothers. Some of the other brothers tried to get him up, and he was later seen stumbling toward the basement stairs.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a group text message shortly before midnight, one of the fraternity members wrote: “Also, Tim Piazza might actually be a problem. He fell 15 feet down a flight of stairs, hair-first, going to need help.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe brothers later returned Mr. Piazza to the couch, the indictment said, where they were seen “back-packing him” -– putting a backpack, stuffed with textbooks, on his back to weigh him down, so that he would not roll over and choke on his own vomit.\n\nThe video showed him, unconscious and unresponsive, his arms limp even as fraternity brothers tried to splash liquid on his face in an unsuccessful effort to revive him. His chest was bruised and his eyes were shut, the documents said. The brothers hovered over him for much of the night, and he eventually awoke, then passed out again.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The indictment pinned “direct fault” on the entire Penn State Greek community, writing that it “nurtured an environment so permissive of excessive drinking and hazing that it emboldened its members to repeatedly act with reckless disregard to human life.”\n\nThe events had already prompted Beta Theta Pi’s international fraternity to suspend and disband the Penn State chapter.

States could also seek waivers that would let insurers charge higher premiums for some people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\n“We cannot pull the rug out from under states like Nevada that expanded Medicaid, and we need assurances that people with pre-existing conditions will be protected,” said Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, who is up for re-election next year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said he wanted to ensure that the final repeal bill “fulfills President Trump’s promises to lower premiums, maintain coverage and protect those with pre-existing conditions.”\n\nDemocrats are confident that some provisions of the House bill will be found to violate special budget rules that Republicans must follow in order to skirt a Senate filibuster.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“This bill is going nowhere fast in the United States Senate,” the Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said. He said his Republican colleagues “should refuse to follow their House colleagues over a cliff, reject repeal, and work with Democrats to improve our health care system in a bipartisan way.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublicans have promised for seven years to repeal the Affordable Care Act, under which around 20 million Americans gained health coverage. But they had no consensus on how much of the law should be repealed and had great difficulty devising a comprehensive replacement. Their doubts were reinforced by constituents who said the health law had saved their lives.\n\nDoctors, hospitals and other health care providers joined patient advocacy groups like the American Cancer Society and AARP in opposing the repeal bill.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut House Republicans said that insurance markets in many states were already melting down, and they pointed to Iowa, where the last major insurer under the Affordable Care Act has threatened to pull out.\n\nVideo\n\nThere may be “nobody to write insurance for people that are in the Obamacare exchanges” in 94 of Iowa’s 99 counties, said the House Republican whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe House vote on Thursday occurred before the Congressional Budget Office had released a new analysis of the revised bill with its cost and impact. Democrats angrily questioned how Republicans could vote on a bill that would affect millions of people and a large slice of the American economy without knowing the ramifications.\n\nThe Republican bill, the American Health Care Act, would make profound changes to Medicaid, the health program for low-income people, ending its status as an open-ended entitlement. States would receive an allotment of federal money for each beneficiary, or, as an alternative, they could take the money in a lump sum as a block grant, with fewer federal requirements. The bill would also repeal taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act on high-income people, insurers and drug companies, among others. And it would cut off federal funds from Planned Parenthood for one year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany defenders of the bill focused less on its details than on what they saw as shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“Obamacare has hijacked the free market and has taken some Americans’ liberties with it,” Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, said on the floor, adding that the health law “replaced our doctors with bureaucrats, because that’s what socialized medicine does.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDemocrats worked to link House Republicans’ actions to an unpopular president. “The Pied Piper of Trump Tower is playing a tune today, and they must dance,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas.\n\nRepresentative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, told Republicans: “You are taking away essential health care protections. You are allowing insurance companies to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.”\n\nIn truth, Republicans argued, with so many problems afflicting the Affordable Care Act, the status quo is unsustainable, regardless of what Congress does. Hours before the vote, Mr. Trump pointed to Aetna’s announcement this week that it would no longer offer policies on Virginia’s Affordable Care Act exchange.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Death spiral!” the president wrote on Twitter.","author":"Thomas Kaplan and Robert Pear","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T12:05:45.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/05/us/05health_mobile3/05health_mobile3-facebookJumbo.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"I0wzr1WQhc8ZwfgB5UvcPw==\n"}

Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois.\n\nThe 2018 campaign is only now beginning, and the political climate is highly volatile. The outlook for the House bill in the Senate is uncertain, and it could be significantly rewritten. But Democrats believe that the potential ramifications of the House-passed measure — millions losing insurance coverage, a diminished array of benefits, no definite guarantee of coverage for those with pre-existing conditions — provide them with powerful ammunition against Republicans.\n\nDemocrats point out that Republicans will have to defend a reduction in federal help for people who have come to rely on it.

She later lost her seat. In a 2009 climate vote pushed by House Democrats, Republicans offered the refrain “BTU” to remind Democrats of a 1993 energy vote that hurt their party.\n\nThis time, Democrats say they will have the last word.

They shared nine gigabytes worth of documents and emails — “a jumble of what appears to be the contents of a hard drive and several emails of co-workers and En Marche political officials.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“It will take to time to sift through it all, but at first glance, they seem to be utterly mundane,” Numerama said after analyzing the data. “One finds memos, bills, loans for amounts that are hardly over-the-top, recommendations and other reservations, amidst, of course, exchanges that are strictly personal and private — personal notes on the rain and sunshine, a confirmation email for the publishing of a book, reservation of a table for friends, etc.”\n\nSome of the documents did not appear to have any link to Mr. Macron, Numerama reported.\n\nThe National Commission for Control of the Electoral Campaign, a regulatory body, said it was contacted by the Macron campaign on Friday night. The commission, which planned to meet on Saturday about the hacking, urged the news media to be cautious in its reporting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“It therefore asks the media, and in particular their websites, not to report on the content of these data, recalling that the dissemination of false information is liable to fall within the scope of the law — in particular criminal law,” the commission said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Macron campaign appealed to journalists to not do the hackers’ bidding by widely publicizing the contents of the emails.\n\n“We call upon the news outlets that wish to report on this operation to shoulder their responsibilities, in all good conscience,” the campaign said. “Indeed, this is not a simple hacking operation but well and truly an attempt to destabilize the French presidential election. It is therefore important to consider the nature of the leaked documents, to be fully aware of the fact that a large part of them are purely and simply fake, and the appropriateness of giving an echo to this destabilization operation.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGérard Araud, the French ambassador to Washington, said of the attack, in a post on Twitter that was later deleted: “It was to be expected. The last-ditch offensive benefiting a candidacy favored by a foreign government.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of Ms. Le Pen’s top allies, Florian Philippot, the vice president of her party, the National Front, asked on Twitter: “Will the #Macronleaks learn things that investigative journalism has deliberately killed,” referring to his argument that the mainstream news media has been biased against Ms. Le Pen. “Scary, this democratic shipwreck.”\n\nMr. Macron, 39, an independent centrist and a former economy minister who is making his first run for elected office, has been favored in the polls over Ms. Le Pen, 48, a lawyer and political heir to the National Front movement her father, now estranged, founded in 1972. The party has taken strong stands against immigration, globalization and the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe two candidates confronted each other Wednesday night in a vicious debate that more resembled an American-style shoutfest than the Descartian discourse that French voters are more accustomed to. Ms. Le Pen, who was relentless in her attacks, was widely judged the loser.\n\nA post-debate poll, by the firm Ipsos — which was very accurate in its projections before the first round of the elections on April 23 — found Mr. Macron’s lead over Ms. Le Pen had widened, 63 percent to 37 percent.\n\nBut Ms. Le Pen could benefit on Sunday if poor and disaffected suburban voters do not cast ballots or if on-the-fence voters who are unenthusiastic about their choices decide to abstain.","author":"Aurelien Breeden, Sewell Chan and Nicole Perlroth","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T18:12:37.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/06/world/06FRANCE-a1/06FRANCE-a1-facebookJumbo.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"sTHJA/jplnwkAV5smvXW4w==\n"}

Klitschko's been out of the ring 18 months and had a 50-50 fight with a so-called killer. I will rip the fraud from the division.\n\n\"You get two types of people in boxing, the outlaw and the Mr Nice. I am the outlaw so people love to hate me.

The U.S. currency struggled to lure buyers after a mixed jobs report and a Federal Reserve meeting in which officials signaled no change to their interest-rate policy outlook.\n\nAnd with centrist Emmanuel Macron leading in the polls heading into the final round of France’s presidential election Sunday, market participants have become more optimistic about the euro’s prospects. In the options market, the likelihood of the dollar rising against the euro this year has tumbled from a month ago.\n\n“The dollar is at a tipping point,” said Ulf Lindahl, chief executive officer of A.G. Bisset Associates, who manages about $1 billion from Norwalk, Connecticut. The greenback “is likely poised to drop sharply in the months ahead” as U.S. economic data soften, he said.\n\nInflation and retail sales will be among the indicators to watch this week, as well as speakers including the New York Fed’s William Dudley. April’s consumer-price report may show inflation cooled from a year earlier, echoing last week’s reading on average hourly earnings.\n\nThe dollar fell 0.9 percent last week to $1.0998 per euro, and is down more than 4 percent in 2017. The likelihood of the greenback posting an annual gain this year has dropped to 17 percent from 32 percent a month ago, options imply.\n\nHedge funds and money managers trimmed net bullish bets on the dollar to the lowest since September, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Net long positions tallied 133,092 contracts in the week to May 2, down from 155,569 a week earlier.\n\nWhile the Fed has signaled two more rate hikes in 2017, traders aren’t convinced the economy is strong enough.\n\n“The dollar has peaked,” Kit Juckes, a global strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a note last week. While the Fed is on track for a June rate increase, “that won’t be enough to drive the dollar very far unless the market rethinks the longer-term rate outlook.”\n\nWhat to watch next week:","author":"Lananh Nguyen","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T04:01:00.000Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iPmwDiv_5R48/v0/1200x675.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"OcCQyLlPrmmSWoqpceQgpA==\n"}

Wearing the white shirts of the opponents of country's increasingly embattled government, the women sang the national anthem and chanted, \"Who are we? Venezuela! What do we want? Freedom!\"\n\nSome sported makeshift gear to protect against tear gas and rubber bullets. Others marched topless. One woman came in her wedding dress.\n\nAs they have near-daily for five weeks, police in riot gear again took control of major roads in the capital city. Clashes between police and protesters have left some three dozen dead in the past month.\n\nLocal news media carried a video circulating on Twitter of the Chavez statue being pulled down. The media reported that students destroyed the statue as they vented their anger with the food shortages, inflation and spiraling crime that have come to define life here.\n\nSeveral young men could be seen bashing the statue that depicted the socialist hero standing in a saluting pose, as onlookers hurled insults as the late president.\n\nDefense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez on Friday denounced the protest movement, and said opposition \"terrorists\" were attempting a kind of nonconventional warfare.\n\nThe protest movement has drawn masses of people into the street nearly every day since March, and shows no sign of slowing. On Saturday, some of the women marchers approached soldiers in riot gear to offer them white roses and invite them to join the cause.\n\n\"What will you tell your kids later on?\" one woman asked.\n\nIn a call with the president of Peru, U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the deteriorating situation in Venezuela.\n\nA statement from the White House's Office of the Press Secretary said Trump underscored to President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski that \"the United States will work together with Peru in seeking to improve democratic institutions and help the people of Venezuela.\"\n\n___\n\nHannah Dreier on Twitter: https://twitter.com/hannahdreier .

Here are the insane results.\n\n1. Just KISS me: \"I went on a date with a guy who drummed in a KISS tribute band. The first thing he did was give me drugstore perfume, a shirt with a picture of his band on it, and some business cards, 'in case my friends want his band to play.' Then literally everything he talked about was KISS: How he liked Daft Punk because they protect their anonymity with helmets like KISS did, how his Facebook page isn't his actual name, it's his KISS name, so he can keep it ~authentic~...yeah. No second date.\" —Erica Sloan, Facebook\n\n2. The god of poops: \"I planned an OKCupid date with this guy, but he didn't show up until hours after we'd originally said we'd meet. We ate and went to my house, and he turned on my PS4 to play God Of War by himself, demanding I rub his back while he played. Then he went to my bathroom and after 15 minutes, I heard loud-ass poop sounds. This continued for 45 minutes until finally he came out like nothing happened. I said I was getting tired, hoping he'd leave, but he suggested we take a nap. I just lay there while he fell dead asleep.\" —q4fe\n\n3. The corruptive cat: \"I was getting back into dating when I agreed to get coffee with this guy. He told me 15 minutes in that he'd broken up with his ex because she asked to sleep without his cats in bed. He said, 'I told her the cats were there first, so she should go.' Then he invited me to his apartment for dinner and told me — very seriously — that his cat would let him know if he could date me or not. I had my sister text me that she needed me for something ASAP.\" —jessicab4\n\n4. The public masturbator: \"I met this guy from online to go for a walk. We stopped to admire the scenery, and out of nowhere he started LICKING MY FACE. I just froze. We continued walking — why didn't I run away, you ask? I was young and stupid — and it happened again! We finally came to a bench and I sat on the opposite side in fear that I was going to be licked again. As I thought of an escape plan, I heard a strange noise. He was full on masturbating. In a public park. I don't think I've ever run as fast as I did that day.\" —Ashley Conrad, Facebook\n\n5. The bogus brunch: \"We were supposed to go to brunch, but when he came to pick me up, he said we were going to church. I'm not a religious person, but he guaranteed that we'd get food after. I'd done the church-after-a-sleepover as a kid, so I thought, hey, no big deal. Well at church he introduced me to his whole family as his girlfriend — I mean parents, cousins, even grandparents. He kept asking if I wanted to make out throughout the service. Finally, when it was over, he took me to 'brunch': Stale doughnuts served for the youth group.\" —remide\n\n6. The word vomit: \"The guy who asked me out worked at a garage but he didn't bother to shower before our date, so he showed up covered in grease. The whole night was awful, but I eventually gave up after he said, 'You ever hang out in hospitals? I like to. Maybe just because I'm turned on by blood.' I cannot make this shit up.\" —colleenh49\n\n7. The butt-B-Q: \"I met a guy on Tinder and went to his house for a barbecue at his house. He proceeded to get high and then streaked around his backyard. I went home and never spoke to him again.\" —bethaniem\n\n8. Fruit soup: \"I went on a Tinder date at a coffee shop. He originally said he worked on Wall Street, but was actually a 'work-from-home consultant,' which I learned meant he was unemployed. Then he went on about how he was addicted to artificial sweeteners and ordered them online all the time. He also said he likes to cook, so I asked him what he makes and he said, 'Anything I can use sweeteners in, like fruit soup.' What the hell is fruit soup?! The guy sitting next to us was laughing so hard his back was shaking.\" —marissad415\n\n9. The doo-doo dinner: \"We were walking around, looking for a place to eat. While we perused the menu at an Indian restaurant, some winged beast flew overhead and took the most massive dump on me. There was bird poo in my hair, all over my face, and down the front of my body. As I stood there, shocked and embarrassed, I turned to see my date nearly having a stroke to hold his laughter in. Things didn't work out.\" —lilycaotrine\n\n10. 50 Shades of Hey, this is awkward: \"A pastor at my church asked me on a date. He and I have always gotten along and he seemed cool, so I figured, why not? We met up at a nice restaurant and the evening was going so well when he told me that he'd bought us tickets to see a movie — 50 Shades of Grey. I don't think it would have been THAT awkward if it weren't for his intense hand-squeezing during the sex scenes of the film.\" —wats0436\n\n11. The chauffeur: \"He invited me to his house where he was supposed to cook me dinner. When I arrived, he asked for a ride to IKEA because he'd just sold his dining room table on Craigslist and needed another. I found out then that he didn't have a car. So I drove him, and when we got back to his place, I watched TV with his roommate's girlfriend while he made dinner. Afterward, he asked if I wanted to stay the night because he had a job interview in the morning that he needed a ride to. I hightailed it out of there. I have no idea why I stayed as long as I did.\" —heatheri42\n\n12. The South Park shitshow: \"A guy from high school contacted me my junior year of college, so we talked for a few weeks while we waited to meet in-person over break. He picked me up and took me to the house he was renting with some other guys, and we went directly to his room where he had a card table set up in front of his TV. He turned on South Park and brought in burnt, flaky grilled cheese sandwiches and a bag of tortilla chips, and we had the worst conversation. Then we sat on his bed and he repeatedly kept trying to touch my butt. I only lasted two episodes before I told him to take me home.\" —flybiknight\n\n13. The series of unfortunate events: \"He took me bowling. During my turn I heard him snickering behind me, saying, 'I'm definitely an ass man.' Afterward, we went to his apartment where he gave me a wilted rose and told me his date last week didn't want it. Then we sat down to watch a movie and he leaned in close, saying, 'hold me,' in a baby voice. I shot up off the couch and said I needed to go and he had to drive me home. I flew out of the apartment, forgetting that there were stairs. I fell hard, twisted my ankle, and landed on my pager (this was a loooong time ago). Then I had to walk to his car acting like I wasn't hurt so he'd keep his hands off me.\" —e409\n\n14. The puke partner: \"The whole night he kept explaining that he wouldn't see Avatar because it was about 'white guilt.' Then, after he mentioned knocking me up at least three times, I feigned a bad headache — but he wouldn't let me go home. Finally, I faked throwing up in the bathroom. He tried to get me to come to the hotel he was staying at anyway, but I was insistent about leaving. We were supposed to hang out the next day, and I couldn't. It was too much. He then sent me a bill for his gas, hotel room, and dinner.\" —kristind11\n\n15. The theater tragedy: \"In college, I met a girl who asked me out. My friends all told me she was a bit strange, but she seemed nice. We went to the cinema and while waiting in line she turned to me and asked if I heard the man next to us whispering her name. I was confused as hell. Then while we watched the movie, she told me she'd seen the movie, and then gave spoilers — all of which were wrong. WTF?\" —layton99\n\n16. The Myspace mishap: \"I met a guy on Myspace and he lived seven hours away in Georgia, so I drove out to meet him. He wanted to take me to his favorite restaurant, which turned out to be Hooters. After dinner, we went to a sports store where he bought a 3-foot bulldog statue. On the way back, he told me he needed to make a stop... at the cemetery, so he could put his new statue on his dad's grave. Still convinced he could be my soulmate, I patted his back while he cried, asking how his father passed away. He replied, 'We went huntin'. And I couldn't see over the bushes, and shot my gun and missed the deer.' The worst part of this whole story? He didn't call ME back.\" —jclane117\n\n17. And the dinner disaster: \"We went for dinner at an average restaurant. He ordered a shot with our appetizers — okay. Several drinks later, he started talking about his ex-wife and what a 'bitch' she was. As the evening went on with the subject of conversation never changing, he got more drunk until finally he confessed to me that he tried to hire someone to kill his ex-wife. They had it all planned out, but he ended up not having enough money to pay for it.\" —Tonya Welch, Facebook\n\nNote: Submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.","author":"Anna Kopsky","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T00:01:02.000Z"},"source":"buzzfeed","urlToImage":"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-05/3/15/tmp/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/d225b727ec94a5cb93981aeed8f89431-11.jpg?crop=546:286;0,10","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"tk4xMpZ6ZlUGdhbW+7Dk4A==\n"}

But that's its job","url":"http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/05/media/stephen-colbert-donald-trump-fcc/index.html","text":"Right now there's a severe overreaction to the FCC chairman's comments about Stephen Colbert.\n\nNo, the government is not trying to muzzle one of the most famous comedians in America because he made a vulgar joke about President Trump. Colbert is not being censored.\n\nDespite all of Friday's social media chatter and conflicting news headlines, the FCC is doing exactly what it always does.\n\nFollowing Monday's barrage of jokes, including one that implied Trump was taking part in a sexual act with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Colbert and \"The Late Show\" found itself in the middle of a backlash. Trump supporters felt he had crossed the line, and others said the joke was homophobic.\n\nOn Thursday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai was asked on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT if Colbert's comments violated FCC decency rules.\n\n\"I have had a chance to see the clip now and so, as we get complaints, and we've gotten a number of them, we are going to take the facts that we find and we are going to apply the law as it's been set out by the Supreme Court and other courts and we'll take the appropriate action,\" Pai said.\n\nRelated: Colbert mocks House Republicans after Obamacare repeal passes\n\nAn FCC spokesman further conveyed this point to CNNMoney: \"We review all consumer complaints as a matter of standard practice and rely on the law to determine whether action is warranted. The fact that a complaint is reviewed doesn't speak one way or another as to whether it has any merit.\"\n\nWord that the FCC is looking into Colbert's comments may seem to some like blow back against the host for going after the president. But the FCC is just doing its job to review public complaints.\n\nThe FCC's \"safe harbor\" provision, designed to protect children, seeks to prevent stations from airing indecent material before 10 p.m. From 10 p.m. until 6 a.m., a broadcaster can only be penalized for offering material that is deemed \"obscene\" -- a significantly higher standard.\n\nOnce a viewer complaint is filed, it's forwarded to FCC staff for review and, according to the FCC's website, \"If the FCC determines the material is indecent or profane, we will take further action, including possibly imposing monetary penalties.\"\n\nBut Colbert's joke about Trump and Putin was bleeped out and broadcast late at night.\n\nOn Wednesday night's show, Colbert responded to the controversy by saying he didn't regret the jokes.\n\n\"He, I believe, can take care of himself. I have jokes; he has the launch codes. So, it's a fair fight,\" the host said of the President.\n\nRelated: Stephen Colbert responds to #FireColbert backlash\n\nHowever, Colbert did add that, if he had to do it over, he would \"change a few words that were cruder than they needed to be.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to repeat the phrase, but I just want to say for the record, life is short, and anyone who expresses their love for another person, in their own way, is to me, an American hero,\" Colbert said.\n\nCBS declined to comment on this story.\n\n--CNNMoney's Jackie Wattles contributed to this report","author":"Frank Pallotta","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T09:41:36.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/151117083530-stephen-colbert-late-show-desk-780x439.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"W34B3iSroUoLfTnCQUrWLw==\n"}

CNN commentators Judy Gold, Paul Callan and Danny Cevallos weigh in on what should happen next:","title":"Is Colbert's Tump joke a firing offense?","url":"http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/06/opinions/stephen-colbert-gold-callan-cevallos/index.html","text":"(CNN) Late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert is the target of an online campaign aimed at getting him fired over jokes he made about President Donald Trump this week; he is also the subject of a complaint review by the Federal Communications Commission. Three CNN commentators weigh in on what they think should happen next:\n\nJudy Gold: The hypocrisy of slamming Colbert\n\nStephen Colbert is an amazing entertainer. He's consistently funny, has impeccable timing, conducts flawless interviews and has a very clear point of view.\n\nI don't know a comic or writer in the industry who doesn't recognize his unique brilliance. I, for one, am very grateful that he has a late night show, and not only because I was a recent guest on his couch -- well, chair.\n\nIt's a comedy writer's dream to hear her jokes delivered by a master, and that happens for Colbert writers every night at 11:30 on CBS. But on Monday, when some people took offense at what they deemed \"off-color\" jokes about President Donald Trump, there began a #FireColbert campaign on social media.\n\nI find it ironic that these people would start a campaign to fire a public figure for what, in their assessment, were lewd comments, when citizens of the United States, and people all over the world, for that matter, just lived through the presidential campaign of one of the lewdest, most misogynistic, insulting, undignified men we've ever seen.\n\nJUST WATCHED Stephen Colbert responds to #FireColbert Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Stephen Colbert responds to #FireColbert 01:11\n\nThe one that still makes me guffaw is the one when he said, \"No one respects women more than me.\"\n\nAnd he got hired, not fired. So please stop this ridiculous campaign -- it's fake news -- for real.\n\nJudy Gold is a stand-up comic in New York, actress, writer and winner of two Emmy Awards. She is the host of the podcast \"Kill Me Now,\" available on CBS' play.it and iTunes or at judygold.com/podcast. Follow her on Twitter @JewdyGold. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\nPaul Callan: CBS should fire Colbert, the King of Smug\n\nPaul Callan\n\nCBS should have the guts to fire Stephen Colbert for the crude and vulgar humor he has used to insult the President of the United States. In an astonishing display of vituperative language, the popular CBS \"Late Night\" host earlier this week referred to the President as a \"presidunce\" and a \"pricktator.\" His name-calling pièce de résistance, though, was a term that implied that Trump was taking part in a sexual act with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe host of the nation's most watched late night comedy show used toilet paper as he imitated Trump reviewing documents at his Oval Office desk. And Colbert, a former cable comic, couldn't resist saluting the 45th President of the United States with a special version of the Colbert \"finger.\"\n\nThere may be a lot of legitimate reasons to criticize Trump for his attitude, his policies and his compulsive dishonesty but in the end, he remains the democratically elected President of the world's oldest and most powerful democracy. The smug and smarmy Colbert demeans all Americans with his gutter language deployed at a sitting President on a regular late-night network show.\n\nJUST WATCHED Smerconish: Colbert, progressives go low Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Smerconish: Colbert, progressives go low 03:23\n\nAmericans are fond of good-natured humor directed at their elected officials. Johnny Carson once observed that Richard Nixon was \"the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist.\" He skewered Ronald Reagan by observing that \"there is a power struggle going on between President Reagan's advisers. Moe and Curly are out. Larry is still in.\"\n\nResponding to Bill Clinton's line that he had tried marijuana but never \"inhaled,\" Carson wryly observed, \"there are so many things wrong with that statement I don't know where to begin. ... Can't the Democrats do anything right?\"\n\nThe difference between Colbert and Johnny Carson, who presided over the No. 1 rated \"Tonight Show\" for over 30 years, is that Carson's comedy was not a reflection of personal animus. Republicans and Democrats could watch the Carson monologue and laugh at clever humor with a touch of embedded social commentary without feeling that Carson was taking sides.\n\nJUST WATCHED Colbert mocks GOP over health care bill Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Colbert mocks GOP over health care bill 01:31\n\nIn sharp contrast, Colbert's tawdry attacks on the institution of the presidency belong in a barroom comedy club or on cable rather than on network television.\n\nWhat's more, network TV is not a dark corner of the Internet where the rules of fundamental decency can be cavalierly abandoned in the quest for higher ratings. Unlike cable wires and Wi-Fi router signals, the broadcast signals of the \"Tiffany Network\" are a franchise on temporary loan from the public.\n\nColbert's version of Trumpian \"p***y-grabbing\" locker room banter doesn't belong on network television any more than it belongs in the behavior profile of a presidential candidate.\n\nColbert's crude attacks will, ironically, increase Trump's support among the non-East- and -West-Coast followers who elected him in the first place. They see in Colbert's actions a particularly egregious example of the media conspiracy against the President, orchestrated by arrogant, self-centered elites.\n\nIt is time for Colbert to join Bill O'Reilly on the podcast circuit or perhaps Billy Bush on the bus and turn the \"Late Show\" over to an adult -- one who understands that the institution of the presidency belongs to the American people and will always demand a level of respect that is clearly beyond Stephen Colbert's comprehension.\n\nPaul Callan is a CNN legal analyst, a former New York homicide prosecutor and currently is of counsel at the New York law firm of Edelman \u0026 Edelman PC, focusing on wrongful conviction and civil rights cases. Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\nDanny Cevallos: If you're offended, don't watch\n\nDanny Cevallos\n\nPaul, I agree with you on a lot of your points.\n\nBut here's the thing: You're right that Johnny Carson represents a more civil, gentle era of late-night television. But television -- and particularly late-night television -- has only been around for a few generations. Crude humor about public figures, on the other hand, predates not only Twitter and late-night television, but probably the pamphleteers of the 17th century and the town criers before them.\n\nMark Twain, perhaps the greatest American political satirist, wrote in 1898 of wanting to dig up celebrated author Jane Austen's corpse and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone.\n\nHumor has always been biting. Television is just relatively new; it took a while to catch up.\n\nMost of us consume late-night television in a completely different way now from back when everyone had three channels and waited in bed for the Carson monologue every weeknight.\n\nJUST WATCHED Colbert tears apart Trump's accomplishments Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Colbert tears apart Trump's accomplishments 01:39\n\nTelevision content has progressively become more graphic and prurient. We didn't arrive at the wanton nudity of HBO's \"Westworld\" and \"Girls\" overnight. It started with a glimpse of nudity on \"NYPD Blue\" back in the '90s, and then everyone else making television had to up the ante -- including late-night TV hosts.\n\nWe went from Carson to the edgier Letterman, leaving behind the uptight Ed Sullivan, who made the Rolling Stones change \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" to \"Let's Spend Some Time Together\" when they performed on his show 50 years ago. Can you imagine? Ask a millennial what is objectionable about the words \"spend the night together.\" Kids today have been raised with access to YouTube beheadings and free Internet porn. They couldn't imagine censoring a line like that.\n\nPaul Callan is right: Colbert's humor was probably too much -- especially for guys like you and me, raised on Johnny Carson and his \"edgy\" G-rated guests, like Steve Martin and the \"mean\" Don Rickles. But this is not our \"Late Night.\"\n\nShould the network fire Colbert because some random people on Twitter demand it? Because Paul Callan demands it? Of course not. Network television is not a democracy, and we are not its constituents.\n\nA host gets fired not because of some dude's \"open letter\" posted on Facebook. A host gets fired if and only if the potential economic damage caused by keeping him outweighs the revenue generated by him. As long as Colbert's show continues to generate ad revenue, his network will support him. A network doesn't care about a random angry tweet by a viewer.\n\nFace it: Colbert's audience loves the raunchy anti-Trump jokes. Anyone offended can switch to PBS or the History Channel. Vote with your remote -- don't rant on social media.\n\nI don't like it any more than you, Paul, but we're in a new era. Presidents can talk about grabbing women \"by the p***y\" and get elected. Colbert's vulgar insult that implied Trump was taking part in a sexual act with Russian President Vladimir Putin may not be Letterman's \"Stupid Human Tricks,\" but late-night television is just continuing to evolve, just like our expectations for the office of the presidency -- and American culture itself. I just wonder what will shock the millennials in 20 years.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T23:19:27.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170502013027-stephen-colbert-may-1-2017-super-tease.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"J1T0RgBdASg/n7YZUsEP6g==\n"}

Polling companies release usually reliable projections of the final result almost immediately afterward.\n\nWhoever becomes president, Emmanuel Macron, the independent centrist, or Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, will inherit a country bitterly divided.\n\nFrance is suffering from high unemployment, a stagnant economy and security worries. The government has struggled to cope with immigration and integration.\n\nIn the first round two weeks ago, voters rejected representatives of all the traditional mainstream political parties in France. Macron and Le Pen topped an 11-strong field, taking 24% and 21% of the vote respectively.\n\nSince then, Le Pen has been battling to extend her appeal beyond her traditional base of supporters, while Macron has been attempting to convince voters that he is not part of the political elite they rejected in the first round.\n\nMacron, 39, has campaigned on a pro-Europe, pro-integration platform. Le Pen, 48, has suggested she would aim to take France out of the European Union, withdraw it from NATO and forge closer ties with Russia.\n\nBoth traded insults in a bad-tempered head-to-head debate on French television on Wednesday. He called her a liar who sowed division and hatred, while she accused him of being soft on terrorism and said he would preside over a nation enfeebled by its powerful neighbor, Germany.\n\nLe Pen and Macron faced each other in a bad-tempered TV debate.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the debate, the Paris prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation after Macron filed a complaint against Le Pen following her claim during the debate that he may have an offshore account in the Bahamas.\n\nJUST WATCHED Le Pen supporters explain why she has their vote Replay More Videos ...

But the unknown quantity is turnout: A campaign launched last week urged voters to stay at home, leave their ballot envelope empty or submit a blank piece of paper instead of a ballot slip.\n\nHours before the official close of campaigning Friday, Macron's campaign announced he had been the target of a \"massive and coordinated\" hacking operation.\n\nMacron's party said the hackers had mixed fake documents with authentic ones \"to create confusion and misinformation.\"\n\nBoycott 2017 badges at a May Day rally in Paris. The Boycott 2017 campaign calls on voters to back \"neither Le Pen, nor Macron.\n\nOfficial government figures show more people decided to abstain from voting in the April 23 first round of the election than voted for any single candidate -- including Macron and National Front's Le Pen.\n\nIt is thought that Macron would be hit hardest by a high abstention rate.\n\nThe big challenge for Le Pen is to broaden her appeal. At the end of last month, she announced that she had temporarily stepped down from her position as leader of the National Front. Some saw that as an attempt to distance herself from the party, regarded as toxic by many in France.\n\nBut her position in the polls has barely moved since the first round. If Le Pen is elected, it would be one of the biggest upsets in postwar French political history.","author":"James Masters and Bryony Jones, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T06:02:00.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170505140619-02-french-election-run-up-0504-super-tease.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"lxX+mXXmHDKz+f2jyFsSbw==\n"}

I am Chris Pine.”\n\nBringing out Leslie Jones, who’s “seen all of my movies,” he says, she wastes no time telling everyone who he really is. “You’re Captain America, Chris Evans … Hemsworth … Piiiiiine, okay, that’s good enough,” she says before snapping a selfie (which she really did, and posted to Twitter, below, with the caption “Just met Thor!!”).\n\nJust met Thor!! pic.twitter.com/90mlO2um0T — Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) May 7, 2017\n\nTo help prove his point, the star of the upcoming Wonder Woman broke into song — calling back to his royal role in the 2014 Disney musical Into the Woods — performing his opening monologue set to Billy Joel’s ’80s hit “Uptown Girl.”\n\n“I’m not that Chris / I look just like him, but I’m not that Chris / Not Pratt or Hemsworth, I’m a different guy / Not Evans either, I’m my own cool vibe,” the 36-year-old sang in front of a large poster identifying each of the four “white guy” action movie stars, before cast member Kate McKinnon joins him on stage to help dispel any confusion about them.\n\n“You’re in Star Trek, and, uh, Wonder Woman,” she acknowledged as she referenced the notes on her hands, then explaining whey everyone gets them confused. “You know what? I think it’s because you’re all named Chris and you’re all kinda scruffy and squinty and jacked, but in a sweet way.”\n\nAs the song progressed, though, McKinnon realized why the Chris quintet gets so easily confused. “You’re always at the airport wearing raggedy tees that are tight just around the pecs, and you have bracelets with wooden beads from Bali or wherever,” she said. “I have one, but it is from Hawaii,” he clarified.\n\nDespite the poster, Pete Davidson still couldn’t figure out if Pine plays Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America, or Steve Trevor from Wonder Woman.\n\n“Aren’t you this one?” Davidson says, point to Evans. “That’s my face, man,” Pine says, point to his mug on the poster. “Nah, I think that’s Ryan Reynolds,” the SNL regular dead pans.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, a huge banner and balloons cap off the song-and-dance.

{"_id":{"$oid":"590ecb8f9e4da44e4546540f"},"description":"‘Alien: Covenant’: EW review","title":"‘Alien: Covenant’: EW review","url":"http://ew.com/movies/2017/05/06/alien-covenant-ew-review/","text":"Five years ago, director Ridley Scott returned to that dark, scream-free corner of the universe he introduced us to in 1979… kinda. Prometheus was a sideways prequel that bore the markings of an Alien movie and hinted at the origins of some of the sci-fi classic’s most lasting images. (Audiences met a space jockey, but not the space jockey.) But the movie, which starred Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender, and the original screen Lisbeth Salander, Noomi Rapace, was more interested in tackling big ideas, like “Where did we come from,” “Who is responsible for our creation,” and “If we meet those creators, will they turn out to be a race of black-eyed, bald giants who want to murder us?”\n\nWith Prometheus, Scott took big swings and engaged with philosophy on a hardcore sci-fi level — presumably because a tale about the foolishness of seeking answers to ultimate questions and the inevitability of death goes down a little easier with an alien abortion scene. But for all of its cosmic quandaries, Prometheus lacked some pretty basic understanding of how humans would behave when faced with a slithering space snake (actually, most people wouldn’t try to pet it) and what they’d do when a horseshoe-shaped ship is rolling toward them (turn left).\n\nHalf a decade later, Scott is back in the chest-bursting game, and for those who wondered if their complaints about a lack of Alien connections in Prometheus were heard, look no further than the title. Alien: Covenant is very much a sequel to the 2012 movie, but one that knows the crowd showed up to hear the hits.\n\nThe set-up is familiar and cozy, like reuniting with an old high school sweetheart (who has been secretly infected with a deadly pathogen). The spacecraft Covenant is headed to a distant planet carrying 2000 cyro-slumbering colonists with the hopes of establishing a settlement. The voyage hits its first snag when the ship’s computer, MUTHUR (the crowd roars!), is forced to wake the crew, which is made up entirely of married couples, for emergency repairs. The team — which includes Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, and Fassbender playing a different, slightly upgraded android from the one he played in Prometheus — fixes the problem, but there’s another issue: A rogue transmission. It’s a human voice, originating from a nearby planet with specifications that make it even better for colonizing.\n\nSounds too good to be true, right? So good that the crew would never jeopardize their human cargo to check it out? Super wrong.\n\nFrom there, everything begins to go badly. Mistakes are made. Tension ratchet. And people die in disgusting ways that shouldn’t be spoiled. Alien: Covenant indulges in a spectacle that’s been missing from summer movies for the past decade or so. It grosses you out and then laughs at you while you puke (not literally). Described in a review, the visuals could be read as depressing, but in the dark of the theater with its “we’re in this s— together” shared experience, they’re a joy.\n\nGross-outs and gotchas are fun, but they wouldn’t amount to much if Covenant wasn’t so thoroughly well-crafted. The performances are believable, and for the most part, the humans act like humans (except when they’re devious robots). Waterston’s Daniels grounds the story. She’s as pouty and bummed out as any of us would be on a doomed space mission, but one hundred times as tough. McBride proves he isn’t just the funniest guy in any room. Fassbender is given the most to play with, but few actors could have delivered on the levels that he does. You almost feel spoiled watching this guy work. And at 79-years-old, Scott has put together visually stunning, fast-paced, and thrilling entertainment — the kind that freshman directors are expected to make straight out of Sundance these days, but rarely do. The confidence on screen here is the cinematic equivalent of the filmmaker rolling up his sleeves and saying that he’s got this.\n\nAnd part of that confidence must come from knowing he’s made this movie before. Much like The Force Awakens did with the first Star Wars, Covenant succeeds by recreating what it feels like to watch Alien. The tropes it plays with are the ones the original created. Here, they’re reproduced so slickly that you remember why you fell in love in the first place. But a well-done retread is still a retread.\n\nCovenant is an Alien movie made for 2017. It doesn’t have the original’s restraint or eerie quietness. There’s probably more footage of the xenomorph in the trailer for Covenant than in entire ’79 Alien. But the update also speeds things up. The movie understands that the audience knows exactly where the story is going, so it gets there quickly. It’s not going to slow down to give Crewmember #4’s demise some (or any) dramatic weight.\n\nOne leg up that Covenant has is Scott’s refusal to entirely jettison the biblical weirdness of Prometheus. There’s still plenty of vague discussion about creation, but the movie is essentially a compromise between the prior film’s fans and haters. Some of us [clears throat] will miss those big swings, but regardless of where you landed with Prometheus, there’s bound to be something to delight you in Covenant because, Scott — thankfully — still makes ’em like he used to.

Take your seats for the latest Doctor Who spin-off, which trades all of time and space for the halls of Coal Hill Academy. It may have gotten a slight redesign, but it’s still the same Coal Hill School that’s brushed paths with the TARDIS so many times since 1963, and that makes it a magnet for timey-wimey trouble. Having a couple of aliens in its ranks doesn’t hurt, either. Every week, Nivea Serrao and Kelly Connolly will be issuing report-card recaps to break down the latest happenings at the Academy. This week, swordhands are the new scissorhands. Watch out.\n\nRoll Call\n\nOne of the perils of sharing your heart with an alien creature? Just suddenly having swords in your hands. On the other side of the universe from Coal Hill Academy, the Shadow Kin are trying to anchor April’s heart to Corikinus’ body, which backfires: The connection between the two deepens, and April looks down from a palpitation to find she’s holding a sword. (“Oh my.”) Also, her body can heal itself. And she has super-strength. She could always pick out a superhero identity and start fighting crime, but she doesn’t have glasses, so you just know everybody would recognize her.\n\nClass is more grounded than your average superhero tale, anyway. At school, April frightens herself, her classmates, and her teacher when a discussion on the Battle of Dunkirk unleashes the alien within, and she goes off on a cold tirade about the inevitability of death in war. She snaps back to reality with no memory of what she just said, and when she confides in Ram, the pair skip class to talk in his car. He promises that he won’t let her die, but April knows well enough that no one can make that promise.\n\nRight on cue, her father shows up. He just got out of prison, and seeing April is in clear violation of his parole, but here he is anyway. Imagine his surprise when his daughter comes at him with a sword in each hand (honestly? Good for her) and warns him to run. Ram takes her home — with the full approval of new head teacher Dorothea Ames, who seems to know too much.\n\nAlone in April’s bedroom, the teens comfort each other, and it leads to sex. Their feelings are unintentionally contagious; the Shadow King, sharing April’s heart, gets caught up in the rush and gets it on with one of his minions, Kharrus. April’s mom walks in on her after the fact, and she isn’t thrilled, even though Ram handles the ensuing sit-down well.\n\nRight on cue, April’s father shows up again. He’s been lurking (ugh), and he overheard Ram calling Tanya as he left the house to loop her in on what’s wrong with April. Daddy dearest claims to share Ram’s concern; his daughter did just pull a pair of swords out of thin air, after all. (April: “They’re more like scimitars.”)\n\nAnd she’s about to do it again — Corikinus and Kharrus are working together to steal her heart for real this time. April fights back, yelling at both the Shadow King and her father that they can’t have her heart, and she wins. But she almost loses it in a different sense, as she corners her father with the swords and nearly kills him. Ram talks her down. Corikinus, who doesn’t have a Ram, gives into his own anger and kills Kharrus.\n\nThe swords disappear. April’s mother is very confused. April tells Ram he can’t save her, asks her mother’s forgiveness, and plunges her hand into Jackie’s chest. WHAT? The Shadow King feels the effect of whatever April is doing, and so does Jackie; she falls out of her wheelchair, and it looks like she won’t be needing it anymore.\n\nThen, rather than explain to her mother (and us) what exactly just happened, April swords up once again, slashes a tear in space and time, and jumps through it. She’s taking the fight directly to Corikinus. Without much of a second thought, Ram leaps through and joins her.\n\nWhile those two are off to fight fiery alien monsters in a shadow realm, the rest of our gang seems to be gearing up for a much prettier (but no less deadly) fight. Flower petals have been blowing into town on the breeze, and they’ve got a bite to them: Every time they draw blood, they multiply — a lot. Right now, they’re feeding on pricked fingers and squirrels, but as they start to take over, they’ll be coming for everyone.\n\nThis info comes to us courtesy of Dorothea Ames, who knows everything about everyone. She tells Quill that the Governors, the same group who sent a robot to keep an eye on her classroom, are impressed with her work, so she’s either one of them or she’s in cahoots with them — unless, of course, she’s a free agent using them to get what she wants. Quill can’t tell either. At the moment, she doesn’t much care. Ames is offering what she wants most — that Arn out of her head — if Quill will just help her fight some deadly flower petals.

The only catch is she’ll be moving in with five new housemates. This proves to be a bit of a problem when house hunting, because Shireen, Felicity, Harry, Pavel, and Paul (not sure about Bill herself) all want a lot of space for a low price. LOL. But just as they’re about to give up at the estate agent’s office, they run into an older gentleman who looks like he’s stepped out of a Scooby Doo cartoon (guest star David Suchet) and is looking to rent his ginormous and mostly wood-furnished house. And despite my shouted suggestions to ask about the washer-dryer situation or whether he’ll be living on the premises, it doesn’t take the group long after a cursory visit to sign the contract to call this place home, sweet home.\n\nAnd within no time, the house (or something in it) claims its first victim: Pavel. Not that anyone else notices. They’re all trying to charge their phones or see why they don’t have reception. Thankfully, the Doctor, who helped move Bill in, is still around for when the house’s creepy creakiness ramps up. As he tucks into the Chinese food they ordered and cranks up Little Mix on Bill’s Spotify playlist, Suchet’s Landlord makes an appearance. He first uses a tuning fork on the walls, and then when he fails to tell the Doctor who the current English Prime Minister is, he suggests they both leave.\n\nAnd despite Bill also asking that he go, the Doctor stays put, which is absolutely the right choice in this case as the house first takes Paul (who Shireen had a crush on despite his interest in Bill), and then Felicity, whose claustrophobia saw her escape through a window, only to be swallowed by the grounds.\n\nLater, Bill and Shireen find Pavel half absorbed into the wall — not unlike Ursula in the pavement back in Season 2’s “Love \u0026 Monsters” — to which the Landlord quickly puts a stop. Having witnessed a wall swallow their new friend, both girls run towards the tower, with Bill figuring out how to get in (a book on the shelf!). Once up there, they run into Eliza, the Landlord’s daughter… only she’s turned into wood completely.\n\nElsewhere in the house, the Doctor and Paul discover that the house is infested with intergalactic wood lice (a.k.a. “dryads”) that can pass through objects on a cellular level. After they swallow Paul, the Doctor convinces the Landlord that maybe as a “doctor” he can actually help save Eliza, who these bugs have been keeping alive. They arrive in Eliza’s room just a few seconds after the bugs have taken Shireen. In a bid to save Bill, the Doctor attempts to reason with the Landlord, asking how this happened to his daughter. But in getting him to talk (about how Eliza’s music box activated the bugs he’d found in the garden), it allows Bill to exercise her deductive skills and figure out that the Landlord’s a little too young to be Eliza’s dad…\n\nAnd with that suggestion, the Doctor uses his little gray cells to figure out that the Landlord is not her father, but her SON! Just like that, my reverse Norman Bates situation becomes an actual Norman Bates situation. Talk about a reverse: “Are you my mummy?”\n\nEager to protect his secret and keep his mother alive, the Landlord turns on Bill and the Doctor. But they quickly point out, rightly, what is the point of living if you’re not experiencing anything? With that, Eliza steps up as a parent, turning the alien wood lice on her and her son instead. She also returns Shireen and the other housemates, because just this once (this season) everybody lives! Alive, everyone rushes out of the house, only to see it crumble before their very eyes, along with the belongings and their security deposit.","author":"Nivea Serrao","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T02:01:16.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i2.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/dw_ep4_12.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"BDJTQB+RXOH6IO3xzrMT7A==\n"}

It would also be a blow to President Trump, who, without directly endorsing Ms. Le Pen, has suggested he favors her candidacy. Former President Barack Obama has expressed support for Mr. Macron.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy Is Turnout Important?\n\nIn the first round of the elections, which featured 11 candidates, the abstention rate was lower than expected, and turnout has historically been higher in the second round. But now many in France are being asked to choose between two candidates they did not support. The latest polls show that about a quarter of France’s more than 47 million voters are thinking of abstaining.\n\nLow turnout and a high number of blank ballots (a form of protest vote) are likely to benefit Ms. Le Pen, whose voter base is shown by polls to be more committed than Mr. Macron’s.\n\nMany on the left or right will vote for Mr. Macron in the runoff, if only to bar Ms. Le Pen from reaching the presidency — a French political tradition known as the “Republican Front,” in which mainstream parties ally against the far right.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there have been signs of cracks in that front. On the right, conservatives who backed former Prime Minister François Fillon in the first round view Mr. Macron as too socially liberal and as an heir to François Hollande, France’s Socialist president, whose popularity has plummeted since his election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore significantly, voters who supported the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round have struggled with the idea of supporting Mr. Macron and his pro-business policies.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat We Know About the Hack\n\nThe troves of data related to Mr. Macron’s movement, En Marche!, were leaked on the internet Friday night, hours before a legal prohibition on campaign communications went into effect.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLinks to nine gigabytes of zip and torrent files were posted under the profile of someone called EMLEAKS on Pastebin, an anonymous publishing website. The archive was shared on the popular forum 4chan and promoted on Twitter by far-right activists, before WikiLeaks gave it extensive exposure online.\n\nSo far, the leak appears to mostly include documents that show the mundane inner workings of a presidential campaign, including professional and private emails, memos, contracts and accounting documents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Macron’s campaign said in a statement shortly before the blackout went into effect that the professional and personal email accounts of some of its staff members had been hacked “some weeks ago.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt said that all of the stolen documents were “legal” and “authentic” but that fake ones had been added to “sow doubt and disinformation.” It denounced the hack as an attempt to destabilize democracy.\n\nThe National Commission for Control of the Electoral Campaign, a French regulatory body, warned on Saturday that publishing the documents might qualify as a crime. It called on the news media and French citizens to “show a spirit of responsibility” ahead of the election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEn Marche! has been the target of hackers since last year.

(Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON — They promised you a rose garden, from the Rose Garden.\n\nThis past week, President Donald Trump and Republicans legislators celebrated passage of a House bill seeking to replace the Affordable Care Act. At a White House event, they heaped praise on their effort and brushed off worries that health coverage could be imperiled for many people if the Senate is persuaded to go along with the legislation.\n\nThere were other bold claims coming from the Rose Garden, too, about the budget deal that keeps the government running through September, as well as questionable statements by Trump on other fronts.\n\nA sampling:\n\nKEVIN McCARTHY, House majority leader: “We’re going to unshackle, build an economy, let people have greater choice in their health care and protect pre-existing conditions.” — Rose Garden celebration Thursday, marking passage of the House bill\n\nSTEVE SCALISE, House majority whip: “There are so many things, multiple, multiple layers in our bill that we passed today that not only protect people with pre-existing conditions, but actually focus real targeted money on lowering premiums for families with pre-existing conditions.” — Rose Garden event\n\nTRUMP, on pre-existing conditions: “We cover it beautifully.... And I mandate it. I said, ‘Has to be.’” — CBS interview April 30\n\nTHE FACTS: The history of high-risk pools and broad expert opinion call all of this optimism into doubt.\n\nIn certain circumstances, people with an existing illness would face the prospect of dramatically higher premiums than other people pay, despite protections in the bill and the addition of $8 billion over five years to help states cover those with high medical costs.\n\nPeople with medical conditions may need this help if they have a lapse in coverage. Under the Republican bill, states could get waivers that allow insurers to charge higher premiums to those customers, but only if they have a gap in coverage and if the state has a mechanism such as a high-risk pool to support them. Robert Graboyes, a senior research fellow at the conservative Mercatus Center, called the $8 billion “a pittance.”\n\nLapses in coverage could become more common if the Republican bill delivers less financial support than President Barack Obama’s law does for people buying individual insurance coverage.\n\n“Many people with pre-existing conditions will have a hard time maintaining coverage because it just won’t be affordable,” said Larry Levitt, a health insurance expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIn the more than 30 states that had high-risk pools before Obama’s health care law took full effect in 2011, net losses piled up to more than $1.2 billion, with losses averaging $5,500 per person enrolled.\n\n___\n\nMcCARTHY: “If you simply look at the facts, more people took the penalty or the exemption than actually signed up for Obamacare.” — Rose Garden event with legislators\n\nTHE FACTS: That’s a fair comparison, if not the full picture. It leaves out Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe law expanded coverage primarily by giving millions more people Medicaid, setting up the subsidized markets for individual coverage and letting adult children stay on their parents’ plans until they turn 26. Altogether, those measures cover more people than the number who claimed exemptions from the mandate to obtain health insurance or who paid a penalty for lacking insurance.\n\nBut McCarthy, R-Calif., is right when comparing the roughly 12 million enrollees in the individual market with the 19.5 million who did not sign up for the coverage because they couldn’t afford it or didn’t want it.\n\nLast year, nearly 13 million people claimed exemptions from the mandate to obtain health insurance, citing financial hardship or other reasons, and 6.5 million paid the penalty for lacking insurance (averaging $470) rather than choose a market place.\n\nCounting both the subsidized market and the Medicaid expansion, Obama’s law provides coverage for some 20 million people.\n\nThe Republican bill that passed the House would end the extra federal payments 31 states are accepting to expand Medicaid to more people. It would also replace Obama’s federal subsidies for lower-income insurance buyers with age-based tax credits.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, accusing the Obama administration on Thursday of having banned patients at a military hospital from receiving religious items from visitors: “The abuses were all over. As just one example, people were forbidden from giving or receiving religious items at a military hospital where our brave service members were being treated, and when they wanted those religious items.” — Rose Garden event with religious leaders Thursday\n\nTHE FACTS: That’s not quite what happened at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the hospital in question. A poorly worded policy in 2011 indeed appeared to ban Bibles and other religious items from being handed out or used during visits, but hospital officials say that was not the intent and it was never enforced. The aim was to stop visiting benevolent groups from proselytizing to patients, after complaints arose that wounded service members were being harassed by some of them.\n\nThe policy was clarified after about four months. Then and now, Walter Reed has chaplains, worship services and in-house religious texts from multiple faiths for patients, who can also accept religious material from their visitors.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, claiming the budget deal with Congress gives him money for his promised Mexico border wall: “We’re putting up a lot of new walls in certain areas. We’re putting up a tremendous amount of money to fix the existing structures that we have, some of which we can keep into the future. They’re in good shape, but we have to bring them back to the highest level. We’ll be doing that with this payment.” — Rose Garden football-trophy celebration with U.S. Air Force Academy, Tuesday\n\nTHE FACTS: The deal to keep the government running through September doesn’t have money to build any new fencing or walls along the roughly 2,000-mile (3,218-kilometer) border with Mexico. The deal does provide $772 million for border security, money that can be used for repairs to existing fencing or vehicle barriers that spread across just over 650 miles (1,046 kilometers) in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.\n\nMost of the existing fencing and barriers were built under the Bush administration as part of the 2006 Secure Fence Act, though some of the construction was completed by the Obama administration.\n\n___\n\nBUDGET DIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY, gesturing to photos that show new steel fencing replacing a chain-link fence along a stretch of border in New Mexico just outside El Paso, Texas: “There is money in this deal to build several hundreds of millions of dollars of this, to replace this. ... “That’s what we got in this deal and that’s what the Democrats don’t want you to know. This stuff is going up now.” — briefing Tuesday\n\nTHE FACTS: Steel fencing is going up in the Border Patrol’s El Paso sector. But that project was approved and started by the Obama administration. In fact, it’s replacing fencing that predates the 2006 law that mandated the construction of hundreds of miles of new fencing along the border.\n\n___\n\nMULVANEY: “You can talk to the DHS (Department of Homeland Security) about the details, but there’s been a dramatic reduction in attacks on our Border Patrol agents where they can see through the wall, because nobody’s throwing anything over the top at them.” — briefing Tuesday\n\nTHE FACTS: Attacks on border agents are up, not down. Most of the fencing already at the border — more than 650 miles worth — is see-through and it hasn’t stopped assaults on agents. Last month then-Border Patrol Chief Ron Vitiello told a security conference that such assaults were up nearly 200 percent.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on letting China off the hook from his campaign promise to label it a currency manipulator: “As soon as I got elected, they stopped. ... It’s not going down anymore, their currency.” — CBS interview, April 30\n\nTHE FACTS: Wrong on both counts. China stopped artificially devaluing the yuan in mid-2014, a year before Trump began his presidential run, not because it buckled to his threatened trade penalties. And the yuan has dropped in value since Trump took office, not gone up as he claimed.\n\nA weak yuan helps Chinese exports because it makes them cheaper to buy. It disadvantages goods from the U.S. and other countries because they are more expensive to get in China.\n\nUntil 2005, China pegged the yuan to the dollar at a specific level. When it loosened the peg, the yuan began to rise steadily against the dollar. Worried that a strong currency would hurt their exporters, Chinese officials bought dollars to prevent the yuan from rising even faster.\n\nThe value of the yuan peaked in early 2014, as the Chinese economy slowed after years of torrid growth. The yuan then began to fall relative to the dollar, but not because Chinese officials were once again intervening to push it down. China was actually doing the opposite: selling dollars and buying yuan to prevent its currency from going into a free fall.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: “FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!” — tweet Tuesday\n\nTHE FACTS: That’s one way to look at it. Comey has a different view of why the FBI did not charge Clinton for her email practices: “There was not a prosecutable case there.”\n\nTrump’s assertion also discounts the harm done to Clinton’s campaign by Comey’s pre-election disclosure that she was under investigation. Whether that disclosure essentially sank her presidential bid, as she and her allies suggest, or was irrelevant in her defeat, it is difficult to label that development a “free pass.”\n\nA criminal charge while she was running for president surely would have been a heavier weight on her campaign, but Comey asserts the FBI’s “competent, honest and independent investigation,” while finding fault with her email practices, did not provide the grounds to charge her.\n\nSome Democrats say it’s Trump who got a free pass from the FBI chief because he did not disclose during the campaign that Trump associates were under investigation for possible collusion with Russia. Comey told lawmakers Wednesday that he felt compelled to make his extraordinary statement on the continuing Clinton investigation in October because he had testified to Congress earlier that the probe was complete.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Paul Wiseman, Josh Boak, Alicia A.

He completed the mile and a quarter in 2 minutes 3.59 seconds and returned $11.40 on a $2 bet to win. Lookin at Lee finished second, two and three-quarters lengths back, and Battle of Midway hung on for third.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was a victory in the sport’s headline race, won by a trainer and a jockey united by New York and a colt owned by New Yorkers who know their way around a headline. Always Dreaming is owned by Anthony Bonomo, a New York lawyer, and Vincent Viola — a billionaire Wall Street trader who was President Trump’s nominee to be the secretary of the Army until he withdrew his name in February, citing his business ties.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nViola is also the owner of the N.H.L.’s Florida Panthers, and perhaps appropriately, the Stanley Cup paid a visit to Always Dreaming at Barn 40 on Saturday morning.\n\nPhoto\n\n“There’s no feeling like this,” said Viola, whose love of racing was stoked by a trip to Aqueduct in 1965. “From that moment, I’ve been passionately attached to this sport,” he said.\n\nAlways Dreaming arrived in Louisville as a likely favorite after a big victory in the Florida Derby and timed workouts that harked back to the most recent big horses, American Pharoah and California Chrome.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen the wheels came off.\n\nIn the days leading up to the Derby, the colt showed up each morning as if he were being led to a rodeo chute. He bucked, balked, bolted and basically acted like an adolescent being hauled to summer school.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt forced Pletcher to be part horse mechanic, part horse whisperer. He changed the colt’s workout equipment, employing more constrictive reins. He put a different exercise rider on his back.\n\nPhoto\n\n“There were a few anxious moments earlier in the week,” Pletcher conceded. “For whatever reason, he was ready to run upon arrival.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe morning drama fed into a bigger narrative. As successful as Pletcher had been, he had developed a reputation as a top horseman with top horses who had trouble wining the biggest race.\n\nPletcher was 1 for 45 in the Derby when the gates popped open, a number that even he found troubling. He annually has 100 or more horses in training and operates his stable like a megacorporation, running horses daily on tracks all over the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“To me, it felt like I really needed that second one,” Pletcher said. “The first one was extra special. I have a tremendous respect for the race, tremendous respect for how difficult it is to win.”\n\nPhoto\n\nBut as a difficult week progressed, the normally taciturn Pletcher displayed some humor that showed that he believed in his colt. He arrived sporting a goatee as steel gray as his close-cropped hair. When asked why, he told a story about being stared at by a woman at the airport.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“I know you,” he recalled her telling him. “You are D. Wayne Baffert.”\n\nHis first job was as an assistant to D.

(1:23)\n\nLAS VEGAS -- Mexican supremacy goes to Canelo Alvarez, whose battle for national pride against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. on Cinco de Mayo weekend turned out to be an annihilation of the highest order.\n\nAfter all three judges scored Saturday night's fight a shutout for Alvarez 120-108 -- as did ESPN.com -- he announced, WWE-style, in the ring at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas that he would next challenge unified middleweight world champion Gennady Golovkin (37-0, 33 KOs) on Sept. 16, Mexican Independence Day weekend, at a site to be determined.\n\nGGG, who has made 18 title defenses, was ringside and had retreated backstage following the fight before making the ring walk to his usual music to join Alvarez in the ring as the crowd went wild.\n\nCanelo Alvarez won every round of his fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., with all three judges scoring the bout 120-108 in his favor. AP Photo/John Locher\n\nAlvarez-Golovkin is the biggest fight boxing has to offer, and the one fans have looked forward to for more than a year. Alvarez has been heavily criticized for having not yet faced Golovkin. But all along, Golden Boy Promotions CEO Oscar De La Hoya said the plan was for them to meet in September, and now they have lived up to their word.\n\nGolden Boy and K2 Promotions' Tom Loeffler, Golovkin's promoter, who also was ringside with Golovkin trainer Abel Sanchez, were able to keep their deal quiet throughout the buildup to the Alvarez-Chavez fight. It was signed last week, but they were happy to talk about it after Alvarez had done his business with Chavez.\n\n\"GGG, you are next, my friend. The fight is done,\" Alvarez said through a translator. \"I've never feared anyone, since I was 16 fighting as a professional. When I was born, fear was gone.\"\n\nThere was no world title on the line when Alvarez stepped into the ring against Chavez, his bitter rival, on Saturday night before a raucous, sold-out crowd of 20,510, but there was so much more at stake: pride, country and all-time bragging rights in a raging feud that goes back years.\n\nBut instead of a fight for the ages, Alvarez dominated and outclassed Chavez to win the super middleweight fight going away, although he never came close to knocking down the iron-chinned Chavez. No rounds were all that close in one of the most one-sided big fights to go the distance in recent boxing history.\n\nAlvarez (49-1-1, 34 KOs), 26, and Chavez (50-3-1, 32 KOs), 31, met a contract weight of 164.5 pounds. It was 9.5 pounds heavier than Alvarez -- a former middleweight and junior middleweight world titleholder -- had ever fought at and the lowest that Chavez, notorious for his issues making weight, had signed to fight at since he lost his middleweight belt to then-lineal champion Sergio Martinez in 2012. They both weighed in at 164 pounds, and neither would step on HBO's fight-night scale to see how much weight they had put on following the weigh-in.\n\nEditor's Picks Canelo, GGG announce fight set for Sept. 16 It took more than a year to get made, but Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin announced Saturday night that their long-awaited showdown is on, as they've signed on to fight Sept. 16.\n\nAlvarez turns anticipated fight into one-sided bout Alvarez dominates the punching stats and the judges' scorecards. Here are the top stats to know from the fight.\n\nLemieux dominates Reyes but has to go the distance Former middleweight world titleholder David Lemieux, bidding for an eventual showdown with Canelo Alvarez, was forced to the distance against Marcos Reyes in a decision win Saturday night. 2 Related\n\nBut any notion that Chavez's considerable size advantage would help him was quickly dismissed, and the talent disparity between the two was obvious almost immediately. While Alvarez was quick on his feet and with his hands, Chavez plodded around the ring and threw one punch at a time in a woeful performance. He showed nothing but the heart to take the beating as his legendary father, Julio Cesar Chavez Sr., the icon of Mexican boxing, watched from ringside.\n\n\"Tonight, I showed I could move, I could box, I showed as a fighter I can do all things,\" Alvarez said. \"I thought I was going to showcase myself as a fighter that could throw punches, but he just wouldn't do it. I've shown I can do lots of things in the ring, anything a fighter brings, I've shown I can showcase myself.\"\n\nAlvarez was so in control that he took to standing between rounds.\n\n\"I wanted to try something new,\" he said. \"I never sit down in sparring, and I didn't want to sit here.\"\n\nChavez appeared befuddled throughout the fight.\n\n\"Speed and distance was a problem,\" Chavez said through a translator. \"He's a good fighter, very fast and very consistent. Canelo beat me. He beat me at the distance. He is a very active fighter. He's very good, and he beat me.\"\n\nAlvarez opened the fight firing jabs and right hands over the top, while Chavez was more cautious with his punches. Alvarez kept pumping his jab in the second round but also nicely mixed in combinations to Chavez's head and body with his left hand before going back to the jab.\n\nWhile Alvarez stalked Chavez and fired hard combinations, Chavez was limited to following him around and throwing one punch at a time. By the fourth round, Alvarez was dishing out a beating and it was clear Chavez was going to have to do something dramatic to get back in the fight.\n\nAlvarez, who earned at least $5 million -- with a guarantee of millions more -- landed two heavy right hands in the fourth round, and Chavez had no answers as the crowd began to chant, \"Canelo! Canelo!\"\n\nIn the fifth round, Alvarez landed a powerful right hand over the top that rocked Chavez and sent him reeling. He looked almost helpless against Alvarez's attack.\n\nBy the end of the fifth round, Alvarez had landed 102 punches to Chavez's 25, according to CompuBox statistics.\n\nAlvarez continued to assault Chavez, whose purse was $3 million -- but he was also guaranteed millions more -- with head-snapping combinations in the seventh round of an absolutely one-sided fight. As if Chavez didn't have enough problems, his left eye began to swell and close in the seventh round. The beating continued in the eighth round, as Alvarez landed a big right hand that snapped Chavez's head back yet again.\n\nCanelo Alvarez outlanded Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. 228 to 71 in their fight Saturday night. Joe Camporeale/USA TODAY Sports\n\nAlvarez continued to do almost as he pleased until the end of the fight against a game but overmatched Chavez, who never landed a single big-time punch.\n\nAccording to CompuBox, Alvarez landed 228 of 604 punches (38 percent) and Chavez landed just 71 of 302 (24 percent), a miserable total for a 12-round fight. Alvarez landed 83 jabs to Chavez's 15. HBO will televise the replay of the fight on Saturday (10:05 p.m. ET/PT).\n\n\"I wanted to box, but he went to the ropes, and I just needed to throw more punches,\" Chavez said. \"I would've attacked more, but I would've been countered by his punches. [Trainer] Nacho [Beristain] told me to do that, but the strategy didn't work. The speed and the distance was the key. I couldn't throw as many punches as I wanted. My father kept telling me to throw more punches from the ringside.\"\n\nWith Chavez vanquished, and in even easier fashion than many expected, all attention quickly turned to Alvarez's mega-showdown with Golovkin.\n\n\"I feel very excited,\" said Golovkin, who is coming off a tight decision win against Daniel Jacobs on March 18. \"Right now is a different story. In September, it will be a different style -- a big drama show. I'm ready. Tonight, first congrats to Canelo and his team. Right now, I think everyone is excited for September. Canelo looked very good tonight, and 100 percent he is the biggest challenge of my career. Good luck to Canelo in September.\"\n\nAs for Alvarez, he denied he was ever afraid to face GGG, as some had suggested. He sounded almost offended by the notion.\n\n\"I never got my share of fear. I'm very happy, and the rivalry is going to show my skills even more,\" Alvarez said. \"I've had difficult fights, and that will no doubt be a tough fight. But, I always say Canelo Alvarez is the best because I fight the best.\"\n\nCanelo vs. GGG? It is indeed boxing's best against the best, and maybe it will be the fight for the ages that Alvarez-Chavez was not.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T04:21:03.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0506%2Fr207374_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"haFMl+v0th1t1IjpiyzpHw==\n"}

In a 2013 interview with the Russian news channel RT, Seagal called Putin “one of the greatest world leaders, if not the greatest world leader alive today.”\n\nThe feeling seemed mutual. Putin would later propose that Seagal become an honorary Russian envoy to the United States.\n\nIn November, Putin granted Russian citizenship to Seagal, presenting him with a Russian passport in a formal ceremony.\n\nIt was “an ending fit for Hollywood,” The Washington Post's Andrew Roth reported then, one that consummated “an odd-couple bromance that has blossomed despite years of dark relations between the two men's respective countries.”\n\nCongratulations @realDonaldTrump for your stunning victory over your opponent!

He also starred in his own reality show on the Reelz Network, “Steven Seagal: Lawman,” in which showed him teaming up with law enforcement organizations in Louisiana and Arizona.\n\n“I think our biggest problem is the open border,” Seagal told ABC15 News in a 2014 interview about the Arizona season of the show. “I think this is a tremendous oversight by our current administration.

{"_id":{"$oid":"590ecb969e4da44e4546542d"},"description":"Director Ridley Scott takes the Alien franchise back to its horror roots while finally tackling some Prometheus' lingering questions.","title":"Alien: Covenant Review - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/05/07/alien-covenant-review","text":"Share. Ridley Scott’s latest Alien movie finally answers some important questions while returning to the series’ horror roots. Ridley Scott’s latest Alien movie finally answers some important questions while returning to the series’ horror roots.\n\nAlien: Covenant director Ridley Scott must’ve heard the screams of frustration as Alien fans left theatres after watching Prometheus in 2012. Like the Prometheus’ crew, I’d waited so long and come so close to the origin of it all, yet left knowing so little. What exactly is that aggressive black goo? What did we do to anger our creators to deserve obliteration? Why do experienced scientists think it’s okay to poke stuff? With more questions than answers, I felt cold on it – and I wasn’t alone.\n\nWhile Covenant continues to pose new questions, it also provides answers, and does so within a much more immediately enjoyable and rewarding experience. In many ways – stylistically, thematically, structurally – it sits neatly between the existential ponderings of the previous film and the sumptuous horror of the 1979 original. And while it fails to match the original in terms of sheer terror and elegance, Scott nevertheless delivers some imaginative takes on familiar sequences and rich, satisfying answers to Prometheus’ lingering mysteries.\n\nCovenant begins, true to form, with a crew emerging from hyper-sleep. They’re pioneers; a mixture of engineers, scientists, and pilots transporting colonists in stasis to a distant planet carefully selected to be their new home. But during the long voyage, the crew is lured to what appears to be an even better site for their colony.\n\nFrom hereon, Covenant delivers a focussed, suspense-driven story as various members of the crew play host to a variety of vicious parasites which burst forth in gruesome fashion. Scott even offers up a grisly new rendition of the infamous chestburster sequence which is an effective and full-on piece of body horror, though it’s almost impossible to match the surprise of the 1979 original. It’s an early statement of intent: the sterile musings of Prometheus violently give way to splintering ribs and blood-spattered med bays.\n\nScott initially holds back the classic xenomorph teased in trailers in favour of a pale, haunting creature – already being referred to as the ‘neomorph’ by fans of the series – which is no less aggressive and, when fully grown, possesses an eerie quality all of its own.\n\nThe classic alien is withheld for good reason, and when it finally makes an appearance, it’s worth the wait, punctuating the most intriguing and disturbing section of the movie. It remains one of the greatest monsters in all of cinema, though it’s still strange to see H.R. Giger’s original design brought to life with computer animation and moving with such intense ferocity and speed. It’s not badly done by any means, just at odds with how that creature was originally used. In Covenant, you see it so nakedly, performing a variety of actions outside and in full daylight, when before so much of it was cloaked by the Nostromo’s shadows, leaving your imagination to fill in its sinister mystery.\n\nCovenant’s early action sequences are exciting; even though much of what unfolds has been seen before in the series, it’s testament to Scott that he’s able to find new and visually striking ways of tackling these set pieces. Covenant is the first film in the series (not counting the awful AvP spinoffs) to take full advantage of outdoor locations adding novelty to what could’ve otherwise be a staid sequence. One particularly memorable and violent attack takes place in a field at night, with juvenile creatures scurrying between sheaves of wheat by torchlight.\n\nScott’s compositions and visuals benefit from how he dovetails detailed sets with impressive location work. It’s like watching an idyllic postcard of New Zealand fade into one of Hieronymus Bosch’s hellish landscapes.\n\nThe procession of slaughter feels all more heart-wrenching this time around because the crew is composed entirely of married couples. Although it makes plenty of sense for when you need to populate a new planet, it proves to be a less than a good idea when difficult decisions need to be made in fraught situations. It does a better job of justifying why smart, highly-trained people people end up doing such dumb things than most Alien movies.\n\nThe cast is strong: Katherine Waterston plays the resourceful Daniels and deftly handles the tricky transition from supporting role to heroine; Billy Crudup perfectly suits the friendly yet out-of-his-depth captain; Danny McBride, meanwhile, does a lot with limited screen time to establish pilot Tennessee as the most likeable crewmate. Of course, the crew is violently whittled down by the end, but each death feels much more impactful because they’re mourned by their partners – the person who loved them the most, and with whom they left Earth to start a new life. The person left alive is not only totally alone but in mortal danger themselves. It’s yet another effective spin on a familiar set-up.\n\nTowards the end of the movie, however, the invention that dries up to a degree, with Scott delivering what feels like a compressed version of the original Alien. The outdoor scenes are replaced by claustrophobic corridors and pinging motion-trackers. I’m not sure if it’s knowing self-homage by Scott or a lack of new ideas for how to end this sort of movie – regardless, it’s still a fun conclusion, though slightly cliched next to the invention that precedes it.\n\nSandwiched between the fresh first act and that somewhat more predictable conclusion, Covenant smuggles in a more thoughtful and philosophical second act; it’s where the movie is at its most Prometheus-like in tone – ponderous, even a little pretentious – but unlike the divisive prequel, Covenant has some genuinely satisfying answers.\n\nIt’s a movie that isn’t afraid to ask big questions but, more often than not, it does so by unsubtly spouting them out of the mouths of its characters. While the original had enough uterine architecture and slimy things slipping down throats to raise scholarly eyebrows, Covenant confronts its ideas head-on; it’s the sort of movie where characters quote Paradise Lost and listen to Wagner’s Das Rheingold to make their points. It’s unapologetically bold and brash in its handling of intellectual material, but it sort of works for a few reasons.\n\nFor one, the reveal of how and why the xenomorphs were created is rewarding within the terms Scott laid out in Prometheus. And none of this would’ve worked without the performance of Michael Fassbender, who once again plays the ship’s android. He delivers a lot of the stodgier material with ease while gracefully wading through the rising melodrama, conducting Scott’s bombastic sci-fi symphony with total conviction. Even when things become faintly ridiculous, he remains utterly compelling.\n\nAlien: Covenant Ridley Scott returns to the universe he created in ALIEN with ALIEN: COVENANT, the second chapter in a prequel trilogy that began with PROMETHEUS -- and connects directly to Scott’s 1979 seminal work of science fiction.

It’s Her! We break down the convoluted backstory of the golden villain Star-Lord and the gang will face next. It’s Her! We break down the convoluted backstory of the golden villain Star-Lord and the gang will face next.\n\nWho’s Her? No, no, who is she? Right the first time actually, because Her happens to be her name! She has so many -- Her, Ayesha, Kismet, J’Ridia Starduster, Paragon, and of course, She Who Must Be Obeyed -- but whatever moniker she goes by, she’s the golden-skinned being that once planned a wedding with Adam Warlock. And now actress Elizabeth Debicki is playing Ayesha in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2!\n\nOf course, some details will be massaged for the Marvel Cinematic Universe version (that sounded dirty) of the character, so we’re here to catch you up on Her and her story as it happened in the original comics. First, we go back to that fateful year 1977, when another sci-fi epic was wowing audiences in theaters…\n\nThe Basics\n\nThe Enclave, a quartet of scientists determined to genetically engineer a new human race that would master the Earth and its future (yeah, that always goes so well), created the being known as Him in their Citadel of Science, or “Beehive.” They lost control of their Frankenstein’s Monster as anyone else might have expected, and while Him went on to become Adam Warlock, the Enclave picked themselves up, dusted themselves off, and made another one: Paragon.\n\nHe wasn’t thrilled with their plans either, and so the Enclave were two for two while Paragon cocooned himself in an attempt to cook a bit longer. When the cocoon opened, Paragon was now a woman named Her, who set off to find her genetic equal.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nDesigned as another genetic construct in the mold of original Enclave creation Adam Warlock, Ayesha possesses many of the same powers, including her ability to function as a living storage vessel and manipulator of cosmic energy. Through her connection to that incredible resource, she can project energy offensively, use it for healing purposes in both limited (regenerative cocoons) and extensive (immortality) ways, reanimate the dead (bodily but not necessarily spiritually), achieve flight (in or out of breathable atmospheres), and even reorder objects on a molecular level. Even without any particular training, she also benefits from enhancement of all of her physical attributes, including strength and agility.\n\nOrigin and Background\n\nCreated in the real world by the team of Len Wein, David Anthony Kraft, and Herb Trimpe, Paragon first appeared in The Incredible Hulk Annual #6 (1977), but Her emerged in Marvel Two-in-One #61 (1980) and immediately went looking for the only man in the universe for her -- Adam Warlock. Discovering that he had died facing Thanos, Her attempted to resurrect Warlock but only succeeding in raising his body, not his spirit. Realizing this was no basis for a relationship -- at least, not a long-term one -- Her found new purpose as J’Ridia Starduster when defending an environmentally ravaged planet from an alien corporation called the Consortium.\n\nThe character’s intermittent appearances continued after that tale in Marvel Comics Presents #35 (1989), where Her returned to Earth, finally met a fully restored and disinterested Warlock, and decided to select Quasar as her new partner in adventure, adopting the name Kismet in Quasar #40 (1992). By this point, we have to assume that Her has some serious identity issues; well, wouldn’t you too? After some starfaring escapades, Kismet was reunited with the Enclave team, saving them from death and transforming them into lesser golden beings like herself. Later, two of them turned against Kismet -- now called Ayesha (are you keeping up?) -- and unleashed her on Marvel’s first family in Fantastic Four Vol. 3 #11 (1998). And if all that wasn’t enough, Ayesha (or whoever) has also popped up in some alternate timelines, including a future in which she and Quasar were the parents of Starhawk, who by the way was a member of the original Guardians of the Galaxy team in the comics. I don’t know about you, but I’m tired; time to regenerate in my cocoon…\n\nBeyond the Comics\n\nFrom what we can tell, Ayesha’s origin will be substantially altered in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. For one thing, in this version she is the leader of an alien race known as the Sovereign (and perhaps any forthcoming MCU take on Adam Warlock will also hail from these gold-skinned folks’ world). The film begins with Ayesha hiring the Guardians to perform a mission for her, which subsequently results in her falling out with the team and hiring the Ravagers -- led by an ugly named Taserface -- to go after them. In other words, Ayesha is the villain of Guardians 2.\n\nBut since the cosmic thread of continuity in the Marvel movies will surely build in importance as we head into the massive mash-up that is Avengers: Infinity War, and since that epic tale features Thanos finally getting off his purple you-know-what and attacking our heroes, it’s likely that we’ll see some hints of what’s to come in the Guardians sequel. That could mean Warlock (whose cocoon may have appeared briefly in the Collector’s museum in both Thor: The Dark World and the first Guardians movie) finally makes his debut. But if he does, will he play hard to get with Ayesha on the big screen the same way he usually does in the comics? Time (and space) will tell…\n\nFind Arnold T.

Suchet is good as the worst kind of landlord, not only because you just know he’s got some sinister plan but also because he simply won’t leave the kids alone, always popping up and getting in their business. “Yes, we’ll remember to lock the windows!”\n\nI enjoyed “Knock Knock” from the get-go, particularly -- as usual -- due to the Doctor’s interactions with Bill, as we see her here slightly embarrassed by the weird old fella around her new friends. This is her granddad helping her move, she insists, but no, he says, he’s her dad. Can’t we at least say I’m the dad? I love the slightly vain approach Peter Capaldi has taken with Pearl Mackie’s Bill, as the difference in their ages continues to come up.\n\nThe episode proceeds from there as a haunted house style horror outing, with Twelve annoyingly hanging around -- he’s so bored with that whole vault thing after 50 years! -- as far as Bill’s concerned. Her new friends aren’t particularly memorable, though there are a couple of fun moments with them… before they all start getting killed off.\n\nThat said, “Knock Knock” eventually shifts into something more than a straight-up horror story, and it’s all the better for it. As much as I’ve enjoyed Season 10 so far, the one-off nature of the stories hasn’t lent itself particularly well to establishing any meaningful or noteworthy supporting characters beyond the Doctor and Bill. But that changed here as the true nature of Suchet’s landlord and the mysterious figure up in that tower was revealed.\n\nThe landlord’s “daughter” Eliza is a tragic figure, a (quite literally) wooden shell of her former self who has been imprisoned in a sort of petrified state for 70 years and is barely aware of it. The design of the character is a callback to showrunner Steven Moffat’s own Weeping Angels in a way, but there’s a sadness to the character that really brings the whole episode together. As does the revelation that Eliza is actually the landlord’s mother, and that he has spent his entire life since childhood trying to maintain her half-existence no matter the cost. When she tries to encourage the now old man to go outside and experience the world for himself, he can’t do it -- and that is perhaps the biggest tragedy of all here. (Obviously this is the opposite of Bill, who is moving out on her own and learning to live her own life.) All he knows is there in that house, and the two, mother and son, wind up going down together as the place eats itself up.\n\nAnd in the end the Doctor returns to the university and Nardole, who is tending to the mysterious vault. It looks like Moffat and his team are really going to tease this thread out this season, but we do get a bit more info here as the Doctor hurries Nardole away so that he can join whoever or whatever is inside the vault for some Mexican take-out. Mmmm, sounds good.\n\nThe idea that the Doctor is trapped on Earth just like the piano-playing inhabitant of the vault is interesting, but so is the notion that the Doctor knows or is otherwise friendly with that inhabitant in some way. Of course, the obvious guess is that it’s either the Master (John Simm has been previously announced to be returning to the role this season) or Missy inside. But I’m starting to have a different, much cooler -- if completely founded in rumor -- theory about who the prisoner is. Read on for that, but beware of possible spoilers…\n\nSome notes:\n\nThe Doctor as “grandfather” to his companion of course ties back to the First Doctor’s actual grandchild, Susan Foreman... who, as it happens, we spotted in a photo on Twelve’s desk in the first episode of this season. Possible spoiler follows! Could these nods be an indication that rumors of a return for the First Doctor (played by David Bradley) later this year are true? And what if it’s this original incarnation of the Doctor who’s trapped in the vault?! This is complete speculation at this point, but wow -- that would be kind of amazing.\n\nCould these nods be an indication that rumors of a return for the First Doctor (played by David Bradley) later this year are true?

Of course you’d use a TARDIS on moving day!\n\nI was really hoping all the previous victims from earlier decades would’ve also been saved once the house was destroyed, but I suppose that would’ve been asking for too much.\n\nNext week: outer space!","author":"Scott Collura","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T19:20:50.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/05/06/1280-doctorwho-bill-knockknock-1494095591626_1280w.jpg","class":"Technology","digest":"zI65C/QOLctyqP/rJF8naQ==\n"}

Even if an item is below your current level, or you have a similar piece of gear with better stats, hang on to it - you can break them all down to use as crafting parts once you cross the Hudson.\n\nThere are also several gear crates to open scattered around this area:\n\n\n\n\n\nEditBreak Down or Sell Your Old Items\n\nBefore heading to the evac point after completing the first main mission (Precinct Siege), head back to the Plymouth Rock safehouse to sell off any inferior gear you have, or dismantle it in the inventory menu to convert it into crafting supplies.\n\nThis will either pad your bank account so you can purchase items from the Hudson Pier checkpoint or give you extra supplies to use once you find your first crafting blueprint.\n\nEditHelp Those in Need\n\n\n\nOnce you arrive in Manhattan and exit the Hudson Pier camp, keep your eyes peeled for Civillians in Need, marked by orange and grey overlays.\n\nCiN's will ask you for items such as Medkits or Canned Food and Soda. If you have these items, we highly reccomend you share them with these NPCS, as they will often drop Apparel, weapons or gear for you as a reward.\n\n(Why they don't just trade the gear for food on their own is beyond us.)\n\nEditFree XP Boost\n\n\n\nAfter reaching Manhattan and establishing your Base of Operations at the NYPO, be sure to complete the first Security before moving on to any other missions.\n\nAfter rescuing Sgt. Benitez, you'll be able to upgrade the Security wing of the BoO - this unlocks the Experienced Agent perk, which grants a +10% XP boost to anything you do, so you'll want to have this active before attempting to progress any further.\n\nEditEasily Acquire New Cosmetic Gear\n\nA few blocks south of your Base of Operations, near the corner of 8th and 24th is an alleyway between rows of apartment buildings. Make your way to the end of the alley and enter the contaminated building (marked with yellow hazard signs and sheeting).\n\nThis is also an encounter location, but more importantly each floor has rooms full of customization gear (hats, jackets, etc). There is also a lockpick door on the bottom floor containing a loot chest and some item packs. Cosmetic loot (apparel) is shared between your characters, so consider running through this location with a couple of different Agents in order to score a bunch of new outfits. \u003c/div\u003e","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T07:22:36.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/05/27/contentplaceholderpng-967b4c.png","class":"Sports","digest":"AoAqB45cpPSimbTMn3yXaQ==\n"}

Fathi used to coach football under the Islamic State, giving youths a reason to do anything besides joining the militants’ ranks. (Alex Potter/For The Washington Post)\n\nInside the Captain pool hall in eastern Mosul there are few signs that a war still rages in this city or that earlier this year the Islamic State was in control here.\n\nA gathering place for pool and snooker lovers since the 1990s, the smoke-filled room tiled with grimy beige marble exudes a faded charm, one mirrored in its customers, now back at the tables after being deprived of their favorite pastime for more than two years.\n\nShortly after the Islamic State took control of Mosul in the summer of 2014, hitting brightly colored balls with a well-chalked cue was among the many activities the group ruled un-Islamic and a distraction from jihad, and it ordered the halls to be shut down.\n\nWith the militants now expelled from the city’s east, Captain is one of more than a dozen pool halls that have reopened as residents try to bring back a sense of normalcy to their lives. New clubs have also opened up, betting that residents will indulge in some of the pleasures that were banned by the militants.\n\n“We don’t seek winning, we seek joy,” said the owner, Faris al-Abdali, an international snooker referee, as he finished up a game. “The wheel of life is turning again, but it’s slow.”\n\nNo one flinches at the sounds of distant explosions that occasionally ring out above the music, also banned in the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate, along with the cigarettes and water pipes that fuel the clientele.\n\n\n\nIraqi boys play pool at Captain in Mosul last month. Residents of eastern Mosul are gradually returning to their normal lives, including activities like pool, which was forbidden under Islamic State control. (Alex Potter/For The Washington Post)\n\nMosul is divided, with Iraqi forces still fighting a grueling battle against the Islamic State on the other side of the Tigris River, which cuts through the heart of one of Iraq’s largest cities. After a seven-month war, the militants are besieged in the few districts they still control, along with hundreds of thousands of residents trapped alongside them, short on food and living under daily bombardment.\n\nBut since the city’s eastern side was fully recaptured earlier this year, life has gradually returned. Students are back in school and attempting to catch up on years of missed education. Shops have reopened, with mannequins in newly replaced store windows showing off colorful clothing that was banned under the militants.\n\nStill, mortars fired from the other side of the river shake the fragile peace, along with occasional car bombs, while new waves of families from the west arrive every day to seek refuge. The traumatized population knows the militants are not far away.\n\nFaris al-Abdali, owner of the popular billiards club, Captain, checks a customer's bill. He spent time in an Islamic State jail after arguing with militants who told him to shut down his business. (Alex Potter/For The Washington Post)\n\nAbdali was apprehensive when he reopened his doors two months ago. He posted a lookout on the street to keep an eye out for suspicious activities. He worries that his club could be a target for a bomb attack.\n\n“I was very nervous. We still don’t have full trust in the army,” he said, recalling how government soldiers deserted the city en masse in the face of the Islamic State’s attack nearly three years ago.\n\nAbdali had just returned from refereeing an international snooker tournament in the United Arab Emirates when the militants took control. He said he argued with them when they turned up at his business and told him to shut down. A week later they arrested him. He spent 37 days in an Islamic State jail, all but two in pitch-dark solitary confinement.\n\n“I’m still suffering from that psychologically,” he said.\n\nAbdali, 56, learned to play snooker in the 1970s — Korean construction workers who worked with his father had a table and taught him.\n\nPool and snooker took off in Mosul in the 1980s, Abdali said, becoming popular among students in the university city. There were more than 400 pool halls in the city before the Islamic State’s rule, he added.\n\nAbdali opened Captain in 1997, after running another of the city’s popular pool halls. A wooden ship’s wheel hangs on one wall, in line with its nautical theme, and tarnished brass trophies are displayed on a shelf on another.\n\nHe fondly recalls when national tournaments were held at the club and he had a large staff who wore formal uniforms.\n\n\n\nBalls are racked for a game at the Captain club in Mosul. (Alex Potter/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe city’s pool hall owners began to struggle long before the Islamic State took control. The group and its predecessor, al-Qaeda, demanded extortion money as they tightened their grip. Since 2005, Abdali had paid $200 a month in protection money to keep Captain open. “We had no choice,” he said. “If you didn’t, they’d put a bomb outside.”\n\nComplaints to the corruption-riddled Iraqi authorities were pointless, he said. Now, for the first time in decades, he can operate without paying bribes to the extremists. He hopes that it will last and that life will fully return.\n\nFor the moment, people still worry about coming out at night, and a curfew in the area means customers can stay only until 8 p.m. On the other side of the street is the campus of the University of Mosul, once one of the most respected educational institutions in the region, its ruins now a reminder of the mammoth task of rebuilding the city.\n\nThe Iraqi government stopped paying public workers in Mosul in 2015 to cut off funding to the Islamic State, leaving many residents without an income for two years. Salaries have not been restarted, although some workers, such as teachers, have returned to their jobs in the city’s east.\n\nWithout income, many residents are scraping together money for food and can’t afford extras like pool and snooker, Abdali said. Still, some of his regulars are back.\n\n\n\nIraqi Federal Police members take a break at Captain, one smoking a water pipe and both checking their cellphones. (Alex Potter/For The Washington Post)\n\nSalim Younes, a wiry former Iraqi air force pilot, comes most days. Dressed in a bright white tracksuit with purple, blue and neon green flashes, his favorite game is the pool variant “three ball,” which is met with some bemusement by the younger customers — one of whom dismissed it as a “70s game.”\n\nYounes said life has been on “standby” until now. “Step by step we will get there.”\n\nBoys who gathered to play pool swapped stories of their exploits under the militants. Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old who serves drinks, secretly sold cigarettes, and he spent time in Islamic State prisons after being caught. The last packet he sold was for 32,000 dinars, about $25. A packet now sells for just 500 dinars.\n\nMohammed Fathi, a 37-year-old gym teacher, shows videos of children at the soccer club he ran under the militants.\n\n“I was doing this so they’d go in another direction, away from Islamic State,” he said.\n\nMany still have relatives trapped in Islamic State areas on the other side of the river. There, the fight has been more ferocious, with entire neighborhoods flattened, making rebuilding more of a challenge.\n\n“The joy has returned, but it’s not complete yet,” Fathi added. “Not until the western side is finished. As for the future, we don’t know what will happen.”\n\nMustafa Salim contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\n‘I thought, this is it’: One man’s escape from an Islamic State mass execution\n\nYazidis who suffered genocide are fleeing again, but this time not from the Islamic State\n\nInside the battle for Mosul\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":"Loveday Morris, Loveday Morris","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T09:18:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/06/Foreign/Images/AlexPotterWPostMosulBilliards13-001-001.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"tWctVNBB4A0WiaWrJqE1qA==\n"}

That’s partly because Todd Pletcher, his star trainer, opted to give him more “foundation” and “education” by running him in an allowance race March 4 at Gulfstream Park on Fountain of Youth day, instead of in the actual Fountain of Youth.\n\nIt seemed he learned little that day while winning what Pletcher called “an afternoon workout” on a very slow track.\n\n[The scene from Churchill Downs on Derby Day]\n\nYet when the usual throng gathered at the top of the stretch of the 143rd Kentucky Derby on Saturday evening, there among those in good position bounced Always Dreaming, the colt who didn’t race between last Aug. 20 and this Jan. 25. He made jockey John Velazquez say later, “I was very happy when I started down the lane and I felt the way he was running.” He helped himself to a two-length lead.\n\nHe faced no drama the rest of the way, keeping his lead, adding three-quarters of a length to it by the finish and besting a couple of long shots, second-place Lookin At Lee and third-place Battle Of Midway, with the once-favored Classic Empire in fourth. By his finish in 2:03.59 on a track ruled fast-wet before a crowd of 158,070, he had gone from an impressive being at the edge of the sport’s consciousness by New Year’s Day to the top of it by the first Saturday in May.\n\nFurther, he had given a second Derby win among 48 starters to Pletcher, the career winner of 4,300 races, 1,000 stakes and $336 million, $60 million more than any other trainer, who yet found validation with this second win, following on Super Saver in 2010. “To me, I felt I really needed that second one, you know?” he said. Further still, he gave a first victory to the team of Pletcher and Velazquez, each of whom had won before without the other, Velazquez in 2011 aboard Animal Kingdom. Beyond that, there came a first Derby win with a first Derby horse for the ownership team of Anthony Bonomo and Vinnie Viola, childhood friends from Brooklyn.\n\n“Growing up as a kid, we’ve won a lot of Kentucky Derbies,” said Bonomo, a lawyer, “but never in reality.”\n\nPurchased in September 2015 at Keeneland in Kentucky for $350,000 — Bonomo joked that his son, Anthony Jr., “overspent,” but that he no longer believes so — Always Dreaming had done all of this after his hiatus last summer and fall after Pletcher took him on last early September. Upon his return in winter from what Pletcher called a “freshening,” the trainer said, “We could see right away as soon as we were breezing him that he had extra-special talent.”\n\nBy Saturday, he hit the gate in post No. 5 as the first choice among bettors, poised to become the fifth straight favorite to win a race that used to scorn favorites. Having arrived at the Florida Derby on April 1 with no points, he had hogged 100 there with a captivating run, winning by five lengths with the best time (1:47.47) since Alydar in 1978. And he had done it after arriving in Churchill Downs and pretty much indicating he felt ready to go right away, a matter that did stoke some concern around the barn, as Pletcher switched exercise riders among other tweaks.\n\n“We also felt he was setting on go almost to the point our main focus was just trying to deliver it at 6:45 on Saturday and not 6:45 on Thursday morning,” Pletcher said.\n\n[Thunder Snow, the horse that refused to run the Kentucky Derby, is doing fine]\n\nHe delivered it at the proper 6:45, and Pletcher’s mild gamble from March had paid off. The third-place finisher in the Florida Derby earns 20 points, and the lowest Kentucky Derby qualifier had 30. “There was some risk with that plan,” he said, “because by not going in the Fountain of Youth, he had no points at that stage of his career. But we felt like we were all comfortable taking our best shot at the Florida Derby as his only points-eligible prep. And we all were comfortable with the fact that if something happened and he didn’t earn enough points, that we were willing to live with that decision.”\n\nIn retrospect, he didn’t seem to need the education he didn’t get from the slow March 4 track. He won that day on the slowest track of the Gulfstream meet, then on April on the fastest. “But anytime you have a 3-year-old break 1:48 April 1, it’s pretty special,” Pletcher said, invoking the name Alydar. “We were pretty high on him from the very beginning but he kept showing us over and over again, every breeze this winter, every race that he ran, he was special every time.”\n\n“Nothing against all the others,” Velazquez said, “but this was the best horse.”","author":"Chuck Culpepper, Chuck Culpepper","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T14:37:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/06/Sports/Images/2017-05-06T230551Z_406860170_NOCID_RTRMADP_3_HORSE-RACING-143RD-KENTUCKY-DERBY.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"SW/WHaXKC978tEGI8+blJg==\n"}

(Brendan Smialowski/Agence-France Presse via Getty Images)\n\nIn February, President Trump invited leaders from historically black colleges and universities to the White House, a move they hoped signaled his support for the institutions and showed an effort to give them more clout in his administration. But critics had a more cynical description of the Oval Office meeting: a photo op.\n\nThose naysayers got more ammunition Friday after the White House released a signing statement connected to the recently approved federal funding measure. Tucked away in the last paragraph, the White House announced that it would treat a program that helps HBCUs get low-cost construction loans “in a manner consistent with the (Constitutional) requirement to afford equal protection of the laws.”\n\nPeople in higher education circles worried that the statement meant that the president was planning to get rid of a capital financing program that helps historically black colleges repair, renovate and build new facilities. Congress approved the program in 1992 after finding that “HBCUs often face significant challenges in accessing traditional funding resources at reasonable rates,” according to the Education Department.\n\n“I would rather have Trump do nothing with HBCUs — not even know they exist,” Marybeth Gasman, a University of Pennsylvania professor who has researched HBCU history, told The Washington Post. “He will see them as a handout. He doesn’t understand that he was given a leg up by his rich father. He doesn’t see that other people need help from programs because of past discrimination and inequity.”\n\nTrump’s signing statement was blasted by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n“Trump’s statement is not only misinformed factually, it is not grounded in any serious constitutional analysis,” their joint statement said. “For a President who pledged to reach out to African Americans and other minorities, this statement is stunningly careless and divisive. We urge him to reconsider immediately.”\n\nThe White House on Saturday said that none of the objections cited in Trump’s signing statement signaled immediate policy changes, but they were intended to preserve the president’s legal options down the line.\n\n“Like his predecessors, including President Obama, President Trump has identified certain provisions in the appropriations bill that could, in some circumstances, conflict with his constitutional authority and duties,” a White House statement said. “The brief, routine signing statement simply indicates that the President will interpret those provisions consistent with the Constitution.”\n\nThe signing statement was noticed by the United Negro College Fund, which told The Post it had an informal conversation with administration officials about the HBCU loan program. The takeaway: It’s too soon to worry.\n\n“We’re not overly alarmed at this point, based on informal reassurances and just our own knowledge of how these funding statement get put together,” Cheryl L. Smith, UNCF senior vice president of public policy and government affairs, told The Post.\n\nShe called the White House’s statement part of a “mixed record” from the administration toward HBCUs since Trump took office in January.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos’s first visit to a school was to Howard University, the federally chartered historically black college in the District.\n\nAnd in February, after the Oval Office meeting with HBCU leaders, Vice President Pence told them, “The president and I admire the contributions of historically black colleges and universities.” He also said the Trump administration is committed to ensuring that HBCUs “get the credit and attention they deserve.”\n\nBut many were offended when DeVos issued a statement after the meeting that praised historically black colleges as pioneers of school choice. The schools were founded at a time of racial segregation. DeVos clarified her remarks the next day, making clear that African Americans had very limited educational opportunities at the time HBCUs were started.\n\nAt that meeting, Republican lawmakers met with nearly all the HBCU presidents, listening to their concerns and priorities. The outreach from Republican leaders, however, did not translate into increased funding for the schools in the president’s budget proposal.\n\n[After White House courts HBCUs, budget disappoints school leaders]\n\nHistorically black colleges have often looked to Democrats as natural allies, but over the past 50 years or so, HBCUs have had bipartisan support, with relatively steady funding over that time.\n\nStudent and parent debt and low graduation rates have long been concerns for many historically black colleges, but their proponents say they are essential in educating black leaders.\n\nAccording to the Education Department, three-quarters of all doctorates awarded to black people, three-quarters of all black officers in the U.S. military and 80 percent of black federal judges got their undergraduate degrees at an HBCU.\n\nJohnny C. Taylor, Jr., the president and chief executive of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, praised the budget proposal in a written statement Friday. “Let me be clear: flat spending for HBCUs in a president’s budget that calls for a 13 percent funding decrease to the Department of Education is a win!\n\n“… Not everyone is happy though — some are critical of President Trump because they believe he should have significantly increased the budget for HBCUs.\n\n“Such notions are naive in the current political environment in Washington, now run by Republicans who’ve vowed to reduce the size of government.”\n\nIn a public statement Saturday, Taylor responded to the signing provision, saying the fund had spoken to the administration and was assured there was “absolutely no plan to eliminate or challenge this program.\n\n“We have shared with the White House our assertion that the HBCU program is not at all a race-based government effort and therefore doesn’t raise any equal protection or due process concerns because participation in the program is limited to HBCUs. HBCUs serve some of the most diverse populations in this nation and three TMCF member-schools enroll more white students than black students: West Virginia State University, Bluefield State College, and Lincoln University of Missouri.”\n\nThe United Negro College Fund, in a statement, said that they had sought clarification from the White House, as well, about the statement, and received informal assurance from White House officials that the paragraph is not intended to indicate any policy change toward HBCUs and that the Administration intends to implement the HBCU Capital Financing Program.\n\n“Nonetheless, UNCF urges the White House to issue an official clarification of its policy to the HBCU community, as the HBCU Capital Financing program has provided tremendous value to HBCUs and the students they serve over the past 25 years.”\n\nThey gave examples of how the capital financing program has benefited such schools, allowing Bethune-Cookman University to renovate a student center and provide new student housing, Johnson C. Smith University to build a new science and technology center and so on. The program, they wrote, by statute bases eligibility not on race but on “mission, accreditation status and year the institution was established. Today, 101 HBCUs qualify for this assistance, many of which have a racially diverse student enrollment, faculty and staff.”\n\nFor example, they noted, Bluefield State College in West Virginia is designated as an HBCU, but enrolls a population that is 85 percent white and only 9 percent African American.\n\n“The provision in President Trump’s signing statement regarding this critical HBCU program may simply be lawyers at the Office of Management and Budget being overly cautious and perhaps not fully understanding the legal basis for federal HBCU programs,” the UNCF statement continued.\n\n“However, these programs have been thoroughly vetted by the Congress and prior Administrations, and the new Administration must eliminate any doubt as to their Constitutionality. UNCF looks forward to working with the White House and the U.S. Department of Education to continue to communicate the importance of this program and others that positively impact HBCUs and the students they have served for more than 150 years.”\n\nJohn Wagner contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nTexas police officer who killed black teen could spend rest of his life in prison\n\nShe wanted to criticize Black Lives Matter in a college speech.

(Is there anyone she can’t hilariously spoof with startling accuracy?) At one point, she gets so caught up in the moment — after her co-host calls her “naughty” — that she starts nibbling on Moffat’s nose.\n\nOf course, it wasn’t an entirely Trump-free cold open. Midway through the sketch, McKinnon-as-Brzezinski introduces the next guest, and it’s a “publicist named John Miller live from the White House.”\n\nThe unmistakable voice of Alec Baldwin-as-Trump comes through the line.

{"_id":{"$oid":"590ecb9f9e4da44e45465459"},"description":"Bloodier than you can believe","title":"Alien: Covenant review: a terrifying return to horror that doesn’t quite click","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/6/15570852/alien-covenant-review-ridley-scott","text":"When Ridley Scott returned to the Alien franchise with 2012’s Prometheus, one of the primary criticisms was that the film wasn’t really, well, Alien-esque. Rather than build upon the sci-fi / horror formula he had created in 1979, Scott went in a different direction with a film that was much more concerned with questions about the origins of humanity and our place in the universe. It was an intentional shift, with Scott even saying at the time that the film shouldn’t be taken as a direct prequel to his previous work, but that didn’t do much to curb audience expectations.\n\nFor his new sequel to Prometheus, Scott has made the decision to go back to his roots. From the title to the marketing, Alien: Covenant has been framed as a direct descendent of the original, with one thing in mind above all others: scaring the hell out of the audience. The visceral footage previewed at SXSW earlier this year only seemed to underscore the idea that this was going to be a brutal, gory Alien, much closer to the film that fans wanted five years than the ponderous, often convoluted story they got.\n\nFor long stretches Alien: Covenant delivers on that promise. It’s a film full of terrifying, heart-pounding terror, on par with some of the best work in Scott’s career. But it’s also a movie stuck between modes, mixing that horror with the same pseudo-intellectual pondering that ground things to a halt last time. The result is a film that is a welcome improvement over Prometheus, but perhaps not the home run that sci-fi and horror fans might have been hoping for.\n\nWarning: mild spoilers for Alien: Covenant to follow.\n\nThe film picks up 10 years after the events of Prometheus, with the ship Covenant making a years-long journey through space. With 2,000 colonists in cryosleep and bevy of human embryos on board, its mission is to reach the distant planet Origae-6 and set up a new outpost, spreading humanity’s reach across the galaxy. Monitoring the ship during the trip is Walter (Michael Fassbender), an upgraded model of the synthetic human Fassbender played in the previous film. A wave of energy from a nearby star ends up assaulting the ship, waking the crew up from their sleep pods and killing the ship’s captain (James Franco, who is in the film for no more than a single shot before being burned alive).\n\nFrom the score to the pacing, this is meant to feel like the original\n\nStepping into the leadership vacuum is Oram (Billy Crudup), and when the crew receives a transmission from a nearby planet that might be an even better fit for their colonization mission, he directs the Covenant to the planet to investigate. Daniels (Katherine Waterston), the dead captain’s wife, argues against it, but is ultimately overruled. When the Covenant crew lands on the new planet, they find an incredibly Earth-like environment, but as they start to explore they discover a world of horrors they could never have anticipated.\n\nFrom the early moments of Covenant, it’s obvious that Scott and his collaborators want this movie to feel like an Alien film. Themes from original composer Jerry Goldsmith’s score surface early on, and the entire pacing of the film feels like a nod to what has come before. (One sequence towards the end of the film even plays like a 7-minute supercut of the original.) Meeting the crew of the Covenant only strengthens that connection. Characters like the pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride), and his no-nonsense wife, Faris (Amy Seimetz) are human and relatable, calling back to the “truckers in space” vibe that made the original Alien such a novel break from sci-fi convention in the first place.\n\nWhen it comes time for the monsters to reveal themselves and wreak havok, however, Scott doesn’t just prove that he’s still able to call upon the horror sensibilities that served him before. He takes the opportunity to show off how much he’s learned in the past 38 years, turning up the tension and squirm-in-your-seat anxiety to the point where it’s nearly unbearable at times. One of the posters for Alien: Covenant features just the face of the infamous xenomorph along with the word “run”, and that juxtaposition perfectly encapsulates the film’s best moments. When it’s humming, Alien: Covenant isn’t just a return to sci-fi horror. It’s quite nearly the perfect sequel, hitting every hoped-for franchise beat effortlessly. In a word, it is terrifying.\n\nIf only the rest of the film was able to execute its objectives with such flair. Scott may be interested in horror, but he is also interested in picking up the larger thematic questions he toyed with in Prometheus — and once again, they stop the film dead in its tracks. It’s not that these ideas aren’t welcome. Alien: Covenant has some legitimately fascinating notions about artificial intelligence, and how humanity’s search to know things beyond our grasp could ultimately prove to be our undoing. These concepts toy with the Alien mythology, upending it and giving it a spin, to the point where everything audiences have known since 1979 is suddenly called into question. But it often feels like there are two different movies spliced together, resulting in an odd and awkward mix of tones, with each undermining the other.\n\nFeels as if two totally different movies have been spliced together\n\nPerhaps even more frustrating is that Alien: Covenant, in its desire to take things in a different direction, actually makes it fundamentally unclear how these first two films lead to the original Alien in the first place. I’m not going to go into spoilers on this particular point, but Prometheus ended with Noomi Rapace’s Elizabeth Shaw and Michael Fassbender’s David heading off in a ship from the intergalactic Engineers. While the pieces didn’t exactly line up, it did allow audiences to at least draw some general conclusions as to how those events would lead to Ellen Ripley and the crew of the Nostromo discovering their alien-infested vessel on LV-426. By tweaking the mythology, Alien: Covenant sidelines those ideas entirely. It causes the film to end on a note of frustration, like the story it’s telling is inherently incomplete. (No doubt future sequels, one of which Scott has said is already written, will connect the dots, but that doesn’t do much for audiences buying tickets for Covenant).\n\nWhen compared to Prometheus, there is no doubt that Alien: Covenant is a massive improvement. The scares are some of the best the entire series has to offer, and on that criteria alone it can probably be considered a success. But there’s no escaping the fact that as a standalone film, Covenant is wanting, neither truly making its own thematic points nor carving out its own unique place in the legacy of the franchise. It’s an expanded universe movie, one whose meaning can only be determined when viewed alongside all other installments — including those yet to be made.\n\nThe problem is that the Alien franchise started in an age where sequels could be complete films unto themselves — in fact, James Cameron’s Aliens is considered by many to be one of the best sequels ever made. That is simply not the same kind of cinematic landscape we find ourselves in today, so perhaps something like Alien: Covenant is the best we can hope for. That said, I’d like to think that Scott has one more truly great Alien movie left in him somewhere. Maybe we’ll get it next time.","author":"Bryan Bishop","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T03:45:02.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1lyFGFdskHXAwLf9JiQnnpIEHD0=/0x107:2040x1255/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54658049/DF_14740_rgb_2040.0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"5sd/GgbtthRlI+Fa8Vtm8A==\n"}

There was plenty of curiosity about whether the latest advances in sports science and technology could help a runner break the barrier years or decades earlier than many had predicted.\n\n“In a bigger field, I think it will happen; it increases the odds of more than one person having the day of a lifetime,” said Dr. Michael Joyner, an expert in human performance at the Mayo Clinic who in 1991 predicted that a human could eventually run the marathon as fast as 1:57:58.\n\nWhile the attempt to break two hours fell short, Dr. Joyner said: “Kipchoge, I think, was remarkable.

The modern news cycle is a little different now — less of a cycle and more like a cyclone, the informational equivalent of standing in front of a tennis ball machine. At “NewsHour,” long known for its slower pace, viewership is up 20 percent over this time last year, with an average of 1.24 million viewers a minute, according to Nielsen.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis audience is tiny compared with its larger network counterparts, but the program tends to attract an engaged audience of highly educated viewers. (The average “NewsHour” viewer is 68 years old.) Ms. Woodruff’s measured delivery, with her hands clasped and her voice low, stands as a counterweight to a haywire era of American news, and she evokes the formal manner of broadcast giants who came before her.\n\nIn a media landscape dominated more than ever by the pursuit of clicks and ratings, the thought of an hourlong newscast, untethered to the trends of the moment, seems almost radical. Ms. Woodruff thinks that viewers may be seeking out a more immersive broadcast.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We don’t feel the need to go off on a tangent and cover something that’s the Twitter story of the day,” she said. “Not the bright shiny thing that someone threw up in the air for a moment.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is easier said than done when the person lobbing shiny objects is the president. Ms. Woodruff is keeping pace with the news demands, but she was not supposed to lead “NewsHour” alone. She was part of a milestone moment for women in journalism when she and Gwen Ifill — a trailblazer for black journalists — were named co-anchors in 2013, making it the first network broadcast to be anchored by two women.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Ifill’s death from cancer last November, six days after the election, stunned even the people closest to her. After covering the aftermath of the election and grappling with the loss of Ms. Ifill, Ms. Woodruff and “NewsHour” producers recently began a cautious search for another co-anchor.\n\nUntil then, Ms. Woodruff is at the helm on her own, and the news isn’t stopping.\n\nA ‘Workhorse’ in the Newsroom\n\nMs. Woodruff, 70, often begins the first thing on her packed calendar around 6:30 a.m., when she starts reading up on the news. And she will usually fit in a workout before driving to the “NewsHour” studio.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe offices are a six-mile, traffic-clogged drive from Washington, in Arlington, Va.\n\nOver lunch at a nearby restaurant, Ms. Woodruff said that getting her start wasn’t easy, and that she was told she could not be hired as a reporter by one prospective employer — he already had one “woman reporter” on staff and wouldn’t be needing another. She was eventually hired at the CBS affiliate in Atlanta in 1970.\n\nPhoto\n\n“There’s no question that we were pioneers,” she said of the female reporters of her generation. “We were viewed as odd or exceptions.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe was modest as she considered a younger generation of reporters brought up in a digital news landscape: “I’m convinced that I could not keep up with the women out there in print and on TV now.”\n\nNice try, her younger colleagues say.\n\nRachel Wellford, a 27-year-old politics producer, said Ms. Woodruff set a high standard in the newsroom, starting with the daily morning news meeting, where she is known for asking pointed questions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We all struggle just to keep up with her,” Ms. Wellford said. “She’s just a workhorse.”\n\nAside from its slower-paced broadcast, “NewsHour” is distinct for another reason: Its newsroom is majority female. Fifty-nine journalists are women, and 55 are men. The anchor and the executive producer are women. Many of the program’s regular contributors — Marcia Coyle, Tamara Keith and Amy Walter among them — are women. Several “NewsHour” journalists say this has created a more diverse report.\n\n“We realize that women’s voices have been left out for so long,” said Gretchen Frazee, a 26-year-old production assistant. “We don’t want that to be the case for any other group of people.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is Ms. Woodruff’s second time at PBS. She first arrived in 1983, as chief Washington correspondent for “The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.” A documentary series, “Frontline With Judy Woodruff,” came a year later. She left PBS in 1993 to work for CNN but returned in 2006.\n\nFew journalists in Washington have a longer track record, and after the election, “NewsHour” journalists say, Ms. Woodruff led the newsroom with a cleareyed view when emotions were high. In meetings, she would tell the staff that they would cover this president just as they would any other.\n\nPhoto\n\n“We really rely on her to anchor us down,” Ms. Frazee said. “We always try to buttress up Judy in any way we can. We’ll go get her lunch or coffee, but really she’s the one who’s keeping us all afloat here.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdjusting to the Trump era news cycle is just one obstacle in a newsroom where Ms. Ifill’s absence still looms large. Ms. Ifill, who was widely known as a lively, personable journalist with deep connections in Washington, was seen as a balance to Ms. Woodruff, who has those same connections but thinks of herself as more reserved.\n\n“Gwen was more outgoing than I am,” Ms. Woodruff said. “I consider myself a people person, but Gwen was really a people person.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Woodruff has been closely involved in the search, said Sara Just, the executive producer of “NewsHour.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Judy and Gwen had tremendous chemistry,” Ms. Just said. “I don’t think we’re trying to create the same scenario, but we are thinking about who works well sitting next to Judy.”\n\n‘Needless to Say, Judy Won’\n\nIf Ms. Woodruff seems as if she is built for this moment, one defined by a divided American public and a relentless news cycle, it is probably because she has seen tumultuous times before. She graduated from Duke University in 1968, not long after the drinking fountains in nearby Chapel Hill, N.C., were desegregated. In Durham, home of Duke, members of the Ku Klux Klan were known to march downtown. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed in the spring of her senior year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLouise Dunlap, one of Ms. Woodruff’s classmates at Duke, met her in a political science class, where media was the focus.\n\nPhoto\n\n“Not everybody was as interested in what was happening right then and there in the South,” said Ms. Dunlap, a longtime environmental advocate who lives in Washington. “But she tapped into it. She was interested from the beginning.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe daughter of William H. Woodruff, a chief warrant officer in the Army, and Anna Lee Woodruff, who did not work outside the home, Ms. Woodruff had lived in two countries and five American cities by the time she was a teenager. When her father retired, the family settled in Augusta, Ga., where she was remembered by classmates as quiet and curious. Cynthia Ballas Moorehead said she competed against Ms. Woodruff in a junior miss pageant.\n\n“Needless to say, Judy won,” Ms. Moorehead wrote in an email. “She was a natural.” (A former classmate, Dean Antonakos, emailed a picture of Ms. Woodruff from the pageant, wearing a gown and clutching a trophy, shyly biting her lower lip.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrequent moves made Ms. Woodruff good at making friends quickly, but the constant relocation was difficult on her and her sister, Anita. Another childhood friend, Robin Armstrong, said Mr. Woodruff was “not a nurturing father.” Ms. Woodruff said he had difficulty adjusting to life as a civilian.\n\nMs. Armstrong said: “She didn’t have the most stable background. But she became solid.”\n\nFor longtime broadcast journalists, staying unemotional can be essential to staying employed. In a series of interviews, the only time Ms. Woodruff’s voice broke was during a discussion about her mother, who had dropped out of high school to take care of her four siblings, and later saved up money by babysitting in the neighborhood, impressing her work ethic on her daughters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Her message to me was, ‘No matter what, finish your education,’” Ms. Woodruff said. “She’s the reason I was able to go to school.”\n\nPersonal Bliss, and Trauma\n\nBy 1976 Ms. Woodruff was working as an NBC correspondent covering Mr. Carter’s presidential campaign. During a softball game between journalists and the Carter staff in Plains, Ga., she met Al Hunt, then a reporter for The Wall Street Journal. (He said he noticed her about a month earlier, after glimpsing her legs while the two were using adjoining phone booths.)\n\nNYT Living Newsletter Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.

Jeffrey was born with a mild case of spina bifida, a birth defect in which the spinal column is not fully formed, and in 1998 underwent surgery that left him disabled and brain damaged.

Mr. Hunt offered another example of Ms. Woodruff’s packed calendar: On Monday, she flew to North Carolina for a meeting; a few hours later, she was back in Washington, speaking at an awards ceremony named for the journalist James Foley, who was killed by Islamic State militants in 2014.\n\n“I said, ‘You’re crazy,’” Mr. Hunt said.\n\n“‘They lost their kid,’” he said his wife replied. “‘I’m going to do it.’”\n\nThe NBC journalist Andrea Mitchell said Ms. Woodruff had hidden the stress of the past few months. “I don’t think anyone could know how hard this has been,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, she sounded almost puzzled at the idea that her friend might take a step back.\n\n“She’s carrying the show after the loss of Gwen,” Ms. Mitchell said. “I think she’s at the top of her game.

But they may have charged more “if they see that you’ve been screened for S.T.D.s, had treatment for an S.T.D., taken H.I.V.-preventive medication, had more than annual pelvic exams or had other follow-up encounters with the medical system,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown’s Health Policy Institute.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act then mandated “community rating” (charging the same price regardless of health status) and “guaranteed issue” (offering coverage to any applicant).\n\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

(The bill also requires states to provide other health care or cost-sharing options in lieu of community rating.) But the bill does not allow states to waive guaranteed issue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo if a state chooses to waive the regulation, insurers could charge much more for pre-existing conditions like H.I.V. and trauma — not rape on its own — but they cannot deny coverage outright because of them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome websites, like Distractify, also claimed domestic abuse was a pre-existing condition under the bill.\n\n“The New AHCA Bill Lists Sexual Assault And Domestic Abuse As ‘Pre-Existing Conditions’”\n\nTHIS NEEDS CONTEXT. Before the Affordable Care Act, several states did not have laws that prohibited insurers from counting domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. But it’s unclear if insurers actually did deny coverage to victims of domestic violence in the years that immediately preceded passage of the health law.\n\nFive states — Idaho, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont and Wyoming — do not bar insurers from considering domestic violence a declinable pre-existing condition, said Gretchen Borchelt, the vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Women’s Law Center. Many insurers did deny coverage to domestic violence victims in the 1990s, according to multiple surveys. When PolitiFact examined the issue in 2009, it found no evidence this was an ongoing or widespread practice.\n\nOthers, like the People for Bernie Sanders, shared an image claiming the bill would “end” insurance for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\n“217 Republicans voted today to end your healthcare if you suffer from” a range of medical issues including AIDS/H.I.V., acne, depression, heartburn and ulcers.\n\nTHIS NEEDS CONTEXT. Many of the medical issues specified by the image, courtesy of Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, were considered pre-existing conditions before the Affordable Care Act. But the bill would not literally “end” coverage because of them as it does not remove the act’s rule on guaranteed issue and requires the state waiver process.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf all the conditions listed, the Kaiser Family Foundation found evidence that before the Affordable Care Act, about three dozen of them were declinable — from AIDS/H.I.V. and lupus to severe obesity and diabetes. Others such as acne, allergies, migraines and ear infections could trigger higher costs or fewer benefits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKaiser also stated that the vast majority of people with these conditions have insurance through employers or other public options like Medicaid.\n\nAgain, this doesn’t mean that the Republican bill gives insurers a free pass to deny coverage because of these conditions, though people who, for example, cannot afford higher costs could lose insurance in states that receive a waiver from community ratings.\n\nThe bill could lead to “astronomically high premium increases for people with many of these conditions, if they buy insurance on their own and have a gap in coverage,” said Larry Levitt, an executive with Kaiser. “Even if states seek a waiver, not everyone with these conditions would lose insurance, but some certainly would.”","author":"Linda Qiu","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T04:57:56.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/06/us/06FACTCHECK-01p/06FACTCHECK-01p-facebookJumbo.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"xrZEDJK1IcijaTlBbzZgBw==\n"}

(That would have required dredging nearby Lake Worth, which is tightly regulated by local, state and federal officials.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2000, town leaders threatened penalties against Mr. Trump’s club over a brunch invitation — they said it suggested the club was being used for an event by an outside business. Then, in 2006, officials cited Mr. Trump for a string of other violations at Mar-a-Lago, including the height of his ficus hedges (too low) and attendance at an Elton John concert (too high).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAggrieved, Mr. Trump protested the concert complaint. “I am deeply disappointed that the town would want to penalize my efforts to host one of the world’s foremost entertainers for a very worthwhile charity and an evening which brought great acclaim to Palm Beach,” he wrote in a letter. “It is unfortunate that the town continues to take such a harsh tone when it comes to the Mar-a-Lago Club and Donald Trump.”\n\nFour months after he sent the letter, he went on the offensive using an unconventional weapon: an 80-foot flagpole in front of the club. His lawyers argued that only a pole of that size could adequately convey Mr. Trump’s patriotism. Officials fined him, and he sued, accusing them of violating his right to free speech, before reaching a settlement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn another lawsuit, filed against the City of Doral, Fla., shortly before Mr. Trump announced his candidacy, his lawyers argued that a ban on using lawn mowers before 7:30 a.m. infringed on his right to due process. Mr. Trump dropped the suit days later and opted to negotiate with the city.\n\nMelissa Nathan, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, declined to answer questions or comment for this article.\n\nPhoto\n\nPalm Beach’s former building director Robert L. Moore, in an interview last May, described Mr. Trump as “used to pretty much getting what he wanted, when he wanted it.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Sometimes they were a little outlandish,” he said of Mr. Trump’s requests, “but he always had a reasoning to his outlandishness. If he didn’t get everything he wanted the first time around, he might get enough to make it worth his while.”\n\n‘The Right Tone’\n\nWhen Mr. Trump used a Boeing 727 in the 1990s, it was the loudest plane at the Palm Beach County airport, according to former airport officials. It was once impounded because he failed to pay a noise violation fee. But he would fly into a rage at the sound of other planes passing over Mar-a-Lago, and he often ordered club staff members to call the airport and complain, even late at night, former employees said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom January to March 2001, for example, a county airport hotline logged 88 noise complaints from Mar-a-Lago, records show.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump has sued Palm Beach County three times since 1995, arguing that the flyovers were damaging his club. Along the way, he developed a grudge against the county airport director, Bruce V. Pelly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“He’s a moron,” Mr. Trump told The Palm Beach Post in 2007, using an epithet he has also used for the likes of the former New York mayor Ed Koch, the former New York congressman Anthony Weiner and Martha Stewart. “The worst airport director in the country,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter Mr. Trump’s election, his lawyers dropped his most recent lawsuit against the airport. The noise issue had become moot: His new status as president meant the skies over Mar-a-Lago would become a no-fly zone whenever he visited.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In a letter to the town, one described helicopters as “massive beasts, generating enormous wind speeds and noise,” and warned that approving the helipad would leave the town “powerless to do anything as our beautiful, peaceful island is ripped apart by the helicopters’ noise.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut rather than deny the request or bog it down in months of deliberations, the noise-averse town leaders gave the new president swift approval for the plan. They allowed for takeoffs and landings “for business related to the presidency only.”\n\n“I actually would be thrilled to sit on my back lawn and watch Marine One go by and land at Mar-a-Lago,” said Page Lee Hufty, a member of the town’s Landmarks Preservation Commission. “I’m proud.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, Mr. Trump’s frequent visits to South Florida have prompted a new set of concerns: the costs associated with them.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump traveled to Mar-a-Lago seven times in his first three months in office. The trips gave the county a welcome turn in the international spotlight and flooded hotels and restaurants with travelers, officials said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the visits also were a drain on local governments’ budgets. Palm Beach County commissioners estimate they have had to pay sheriff’s deputies $60,000 a day in overtime to close roads and supplement Secret Service details. They say the cost to local taxpayers has already amounted to more than $4 million.\n\nYet the commissioners were not sure what to do about it. They figured their best bet was to wait and see whether the federal government reimbursed them, as Mr. Trump promised the county sheriff it would.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Thursday, Congress passed a spending bill that sets aside $41 million to pay back local law enforcement agencies for security costs related to the president’s travel to his residences, a figure that will barely cover expenses incurred by New York City and Palm Beach County. Palm Beach County officials are expecting a reprieve from the added security burden when Mar-a-Lago closes for the season this month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarlier, Mr. Kerner, the Palm Beach County commissioner, had suggested dealing with the burden on the budget by targeting Mar-a-Lago with a special assessment tied to the use of municipal services.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

I appreciate you want to push me on this but we are going to have to wait until the manifesto comes out.\"\n\nPressed on the issue again, she added: \"That's why we're having a new manifesto.

Stirling, Joyce and Porterfield are a talented top three but as England have shown over two games, there is little below them.\n\nStirling and Joyce (16) added 68 for the opening wicket but both fell in the space of two and a half overs, the former to Jake Ball and the latter to Root, who would also claim the wickets of Niall O'Brien and Gary Wilson to help reduce Ireland to 154-5.\n\nPorterfield's clean striking carried the tourists past 200 until he was bowled by Mark Wood attempting a ramp shot, leaving the Durham seamer and Plunkett to clean up the tail.\n\n'Sterner tests to come' - What they said...\n\nEngland's three-match ODI series with South Africa starts on 24 May\n\nEngland coach Trevor Bayliss, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We know we have sterner tests coming up, against South Africa and in the Champions Trophy.

If we are 2-0 up with a game to go we will look at the team then.\"\n\nEngland captain Eoin Morgan: \"Bristol was a more convincing win and today presented us with different challenges.\n\n\"There was some cloud cover this morning and the openers got us off to a fantastic start.

Liverpool rarely tested Saints keeper Fraser Forster, bar the penalty and Marko Grujic's header late in the game. The visitors, meanwhile, failed to muster even one effort on target.\n\nIt is not finished yet - we all have to play our games Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp\n\nThe Reds' best chance to score came in the 66th minute when they won a penalty after Southampton's Jack Stephens was judged to have handled Lucas' delivery.\n\nMilner, who had not missed from the spot in the league since November 2009, saw his effort saved by Forster who dived low to his right. Seconds earlier, the England keeper approached the midfielder as he attempted to place the ball on the spot - and the tactic seemed to work.\n\nThe draw sees the Reds move up to third, above Manchester City, on 70 points. However, Pep Guardiola's side have a game in hand.\n\nManchester United are five points behind after losing to Arsenal, who are two points further back.\n\nLiverpool underwhelm in crucial period\n\nMost of Liverpool's efforts came from outside the area\n\nIt was dire. Truly dire. Was the first half of this match the worst seen in the Premier League this season?\n\nThe home sections at Anfield must have thought they were in for a treat - the sun was shining and they knew their team had to take the game to Southampton with a Champions League spot at stake.\n\nBut instead of a siege on Forster's goal, what they witnessed during that opening period were their players joining the Saints on the beach.\n\nThe first 45 minutes were slow and ponderous, and the only exertions by the Southampton keeper were three very comfortable saves.\n\nThe second half followed a similar pattern up until the penalty, which was a correct decision by referee Bobby Madley with the Stephens' arm moving up to push the ball away.\n\nHowever, Milner - who last missed a Premier League penalty playing for Aston Villa against Bolton - saw his effort saved by Forster. Was he put off his stride by the keeper confronting him moments earlier?\n\nForster kept his concentration right up until the final few minutes of the game when he reacted brilliantly to tip over substitute Grujic's header.\n\nThe Reds have now played Southampton four times this season and failed to score against them.\n\nSaints play on the back foot but get a point\n\nSouthampton set up camp in their own half for most of the first 45 minutes\n\nSouthampton boss Claude Puel appeared somewhat surprised this week when he was asked about reports regarding his future.\n\nIt had been suggested that some players had become disillusioned with his style of management.\n\nTheir Premier League status was only made secure with Hull's defeat on Saturday, and they came into the match on the back of two defeats and a draw.\n\nAt Anfield, the team must have bored their travelling fans into submission.\n\nThe graphic above shows that they mostly sat in their own half for the opening 45 minutes, and for the first time since they returned to the top flight in 2012 they failed to have a single effort in the first half of a match. An angled strike by Nathan Redmond in the second half was the closest they came to scoring - although it was a few yards wide.\n\nHaving been spoilt for entertainment when their team was managed by Ronald Koeman and Mauricio Pochettino, some Southampton fans must be wondering what type of football awaits them next season if Puel stays.\n\nMan of the match - Fraser Forster (Southampton)\n\nThere were not many contenders for man of the match, so the honour goes to the 6ft 7in keeper who made a great save to deny Milner and one near the end to prevent Grujic from scoring\n\n'Southampton did not create anything'\n\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: \"I thought our performance was good enough to win. Southampton wanted to come here and somehow get a point, or more - I'm fine with defending.\n\n\"They did not create anything and we had a hard job to do. To play against 10 deep defending Southampton players is very difficult. We could have scored, that would have opened them up a bit. It is a point more, but it doesn't feel like that.\n\n\"It is not finished yet. We all have to play our games. We go to West Ham and try to win, and that's all we can do.

But who do you think is the greatest?","title":"Formula 1: How did tiny Finland become an F1 giant?","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/39765153","text":"Five drivers from Finland have won at least one F1 race. They are (left to right) Kimi Raikkonen, Heikki Kovalainen, Mika Hakkinen, Keke Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas\n\nAn interesting bunch, the Finns.\n\nFor starters, the Finnish word for computer translates as \"knowledge machine\", while a Finn in a bad mood would be moping around like \"a bear shot in the backside\".\n\nPerhaps most pleasingly of all, a passing Finn wondering after your sanity might question whether you are in possession of \"all the Moomins in the valley\".\n\nClearly, the Finns have much they can teach us.\n\nIt is certainly the case so far as motorsport goes, particularly Formula 1.\n\nThe Nordic country may have a population of about five and a half million people, but that has not stopped them producing three world champions and - following Valtteri Bottas' maiden win at the Russian Grand Prix on 30 April - no fewer than five race winners.\n\nYet Finland's pre-eminence in F1 did not happen in a hurry. The arrival of the dashing Keke Rosberg on the scene in 1978 would eventually lead to Finland making a significant impact in the sport, but even he had it rough for several years.\n\nBetween 1978 and 1981, Rosberg managed just two points finishes, but a move to Williams for 1982 delivered him the world title - albeit after winning just one race all year.\n\nRosberg won four more races before retirement in 1986, but his influence on Finnish racing was far from over as before long he took charge of the careers of two rising young stars - JJ Lehto and Mika Hakkinen.\n\nWhile Lehto's career stalled, Hakkinen's went into the stratosphere, delivering 20 race wins and two world titles before he retired in 2001 as the most successful Finnish F1 driver of all time.\n\nKeke Rosberg winning at life - Brazil 1985\n\nAnd like taxis off a rank, 2001 just happened to be the cue for the next Finnish superstar to make his entrance.\n\nKimi Raikkonen famously arrived in F1 amid much scrutiny over his credentials, being awarded a superlicence despite having contested just 23 open-seater races.\n\nSixteen years later and still hugely relevant in F1, it's fair to say Raikkonen has answered his doubters.\n\nTwenty wins and one world title in 2007 is perhaps scant return on his promise, but Raikkonen nevertheless retains cult status in the sport, built on a famed monosyllabic delivery that has made him the very epitome of the unflustered Finnish driver.\n\nAnd as Raikkonen enters the twilight of his career, it would seem Valtteri Bottas - unexpectedly elevated into a race-winning Mercedes over the winter - has exactly what it takes to be Finland's F1 star for the years ahead.\n\nSo what is the secret of the Finns' continued success?\n\nIt's hard to answer this question without wading perilously deep into the waters of generalisation, but it does seem that the archetypal Finnish traits of fortitude and resilience have much to do with it.\n\nMika Hakkinen celebrates the successful defence of the world title at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix\n\nThe Finns have a word for this national characteristic - Sisu - a catch-all term dating back hundreds of years that, according to Finlandia University, describes \"strength of will, determination, perseverance, and acting rationally in the face of adversity\".\n\nThey add: \"Sisu is not momentary courage, but the ability to sustain that courage. It is a word that cannot be fully translated. It defines the Finnish people and their character. It stands for the philosophy that what must be done will be done, regardless of cost.\"\n\nThat's pretty high-brow stuff. Can a shared national trait really lead to sustained success at the pinnacle of world motorsport?\n\nMaybe. Instead, there is a more simple explanation - and who better than the straight-talking Raikkonen to give it.\n\nAsked what makes Finnish drivers so good, he once replied: \"Our roads and long winters.\n\n\"You really have to be a good driver to survive in Finland. It is always slippery and bumpy.\"\n\nAh, that must be it.\n\nBest Finnish moment in F1 history?\n\nHakkinen's pass on Michael Schumacher at the 2000 Belgian Grand Prix - executed as the pair went either side of backmarker Ricardo Zonta - is widely regarded as one of the most thrilling overtakes in F1 history.\n\nReigning world champion Nico Rosberg certainly seems to think so, if this tweet from last year is anything to go by.\n\nFor anyone wondering, Rosberg - son of Keke - does not make this feature as he was born in Germany, has a German mother and raced under the German flag.\n\nSo there.\n\nMika Hakkinen explains his stunning overtake to a clearly impressed Michael Schumacher\n\nHow big is Finland?\n\nFinland has done incredibly well to produce a decent amount of successful Formula 1 drivers considering the size of their talent pool relative to other countries. In fact, they boast more F1 world champions per capita than any other country.\n\nThe population of Finland is just 5.5m, smaller than the amount of people in London alone (8.6m) and 28 times smaller than the population of Russia (144m), which has produced just two F1 drivers - Daniil Kvyat and Vitaly Petrov.\n\nFinnish people love their F1, right?\n\nThey do.\n\nFinnish F1 drivers are treated like rock stars, although motorsport is not quite the most popular sport in Finland. That crown belongs to pesapallo - Finnish baseball.\n\nThey also love a bit of bandy, a sport that can be best described as being a bit like ice hockey.\n\nPesapallo is the national sport of Finland\n\nThis content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser\n\nWho is the greatest Finnish F1 driver of all time?","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T07:00:38.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/791C/production/_95940013_keke.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"ABONOZ5AmSCXMWvg6jfobQ==\n"}

She also said it would be “not fair” and “a mistake” to defund the women’s health clinics Planned Parenthood.\n\n“I don’t think that low-income women should be denied their choice of health care providers, for family planning, cancer screenings, for well-women care,” Collins said.\n\nEven so, Manchin said Senate Republicans haven’t yet asked Democrats to work on a bill.\n\n“No one’s asked any Democrat, and I’m the most centrist Democrat willing to work and fix things if people really want to do it,” said Manchin, who’s up for re-election in 2018 in a state that Trump carried in 2016.\n\nManchin and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who spoke on “Meet the Press” on Sunday, both acknowledged there are problems with Obamacare that need to be fixed. “Get rid of the word ‘repeal’ and start talking about repairing,” Manchin said.\n\nFeinstein also noted the lack of women in the Republican working group. “Women’s health is a big part of this and women are a majority of the population, and their health interests deserve to be contemplated in any reform,” she said.","author":"Chris Strohm, Ben Brody","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T16:43:38.150Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iklVhLEbBMXg/v0/1200x799.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"zwiK4ZuuehoQ8TPwC5gt5g==\n"}

Tribune’s closing price on Friday was $40.29, giving it a market value of $3.5 billion. While an agreement may be announced as early as Monday, the deal could still fall apart.\n\nThe acquisition of Tribune would give Sinclair TV stations in big media markets like New York, Chicago and Miami, strengthening its hand in negotiations with pay-TV distributors and major broadcast networks. The larger scale also would help the combined company face down online competitors vying for a piece of the local advertising pie.\n\n21st Century Fox Inc., with funding from Blackstone Group LP, had been planning an offer for Tribune but in the end didn’t submit a bid, according to a person familiar with the matter. Nexstar Media Group Inc. also was preparing an offer, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nGary Weitman, a spokesman for Tribune Media, and representatives from Nexstar and Fox declined to comment. Emails to Sinclair weren’t returned.\n\nA potential marriage of two of the largest local TV station owners in the U.S. was made easier last month when the FCC restored a rule that allows TV station groups to count just half of their coverage area for Ultra High Frequency stations to comply with a 39 percent nationwide cap set by Congress.\n\n2016 Decision\n\nThe FCC’s vote reversed a 2016 decision by the agency during the Obama administration. New Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, criticized the earlier action because it effectively tightened ownership limits without considering whether to raise the national cap.\n\nThe issue is a relic of days when UHF stations -- broadcasting on channels 14 and higher -- used signals that didn’t reach as far as stations assigned lower-numbered channels. That disappeared with the switch to digital TV in 2009.\n\nThe impetus for a Sinclair-Tribune deal came earlier this year when the FCC eased confidentiality requirements for companies selling airwaves in an auction. TV stations are voluntarily giving up airwaves in the sale for use by mobile providers, and are getting paid for doing so.\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nDespite their respective size, Sinclair and Tribune have little overlap in the locations of their stations. Sinclair has 173 stations in 81 markets, including affiliations with Fox, ABC, CBS and NBC, and reaches 24 percent of U.S. TV homes with the UHF discount reinstated. Tribune has 42 stations reaching 26 percent. With the UHF discount reapplied, they cover 42 percent of the country, implying a likelihood of some divestitures, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis.\n\nWith the deal Sinclair, based in the Baltimore suburb of Hunt Valley, would get Tribune’s minority stakes in the Food Network and its flagship cable network WGN America.\n\nTribune has tried to attract viewers and advertisers to WGN America with original programs like “Salem” and “Outsiders” -- and it’s worked. But higher programming costs have squeezed Tribune’s profit margin, and cable operators have slimmed down their bundles of channels, leaving networks like WGN battling for a slot.\n\nIn December, Tribune sold its Gracenote audio-recognition software business to Nielsen Co. for $560 million.","author":"Paul Barbagallo, Alex Sherman","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T17:01:21.617Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iASMU7TQf1c8/v0/1200x675.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"ngPe0XHN8NPDGlk0qbNJUg==\n"}

Saturday, at the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “And Apple, I regard them as being in a quite different business. I think Apple is much more of a consumer-products business” with skill at finding opportunities that are difficult for rivals to duplicate.\n\nApple Inc. has become one of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s largest holdings, valued at about $19.2 billion as of March 31. The billionaire said this week that he cut about a third of his stake in IBM, sending the shares down 2.5 percent Friday.\n\nBuffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger built Berkshire into one of the world’s largest companies with bets on consumer-product companies like Coca-Cola Co. and older industries such as railroads. Munger said Saturday that avoiding Silicon Valley investments made sense for the pair, with some exceptions.\n\n“We avoided the tech stocks because we felt we had no advantage there, and other people did. And I think that’s a good idea not to play where the other people are better,” Munger said. “But, you know, if you ask me in retrospect, ‘What was our worst mistake in the tech field?’ I think we were smart enough to figure out Google.”\n\nBuffett’s Lament\n\nThe most important business stories of the day.

Given the price that Geico was paying per click, Buffett said, he should have seen the technology company’s promise.\n\n“I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” He also said he missed an opportunity by failing to invest in Amazon.com Inc.\n\nBuffett said time will tell about whether his recent wager on Apple is smarter than the 2011 IBM investment. He stressed that the companies have different types of customers, so each stock requires unique analysis.\n\n“They are two different types of decisions, and I was wrong on the first one,” Buffett said. “We’ll find out whether I’m right or wrong on the second.”\n\nMunger said it was a “very good sign” that Buffett jumped into Apple.\n\n“It shows either one of two things: Either you’ve gone crazy, or you’re learning,” Munger said. “I prefer the learning explanation.”","author":"Noah Buhayar, Katherine Chiglinsky","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T16:30:29.000Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i0Z2OLkfrJl0/v0/1200x800.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"QbdF9Z5P6Dx73CjilHcr/Q==\n"}

It’s becoming a key question for investors as the government’s stepped up campaign to rein in financial leverage ripples through markets.","title":"China's Deleveraging Bill Tops $500 Billion","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-07/china-deleveraging-bill-tops-500-billion-as-market-pain-spreads","text":"How much pain can Chinese leaders stomach? It’s becoming a key question for investors as the government’s stepped up campaign to rein in financial leverage ripples through markets.\n\nThe clampdown has erased at least $453 billion from the value of Chinese stocks and bonds since mid-April, spurred $21 billion of canceled debt sales and compelled the People’s Bank of China to inject $48 billion into jittery money markets. Sales of asset-management products by lenders and trust companies have plunged by more than 30 percent, while domestic real estate transactions have slowed and metals prices have buckled.\n\nThe upheaval hasn’t reached crisis levels yet. But as the nation’s equity crash in 2015 showed, market declines in China have a habit of snowballing. As authorities juggle the conflicting goals of curbing leverage and maintaining economic growth before a Communist Party leadership reshuffle later this year, some money managers are bracing for more turbulence.\n\n“It would take a lot for the country to move into easing mode,” said Howard Wang, the Hong Kong-based head of greater China at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees about $1.8 trillion worldwide. “They will adjust their policies if markets go down another 10 percent or the currency cracks under pressure. Only these very drastic swings will make them move the other way.”\n\nChina’s banking, insurance and securities regulators have all played a part in the clampdown, focusing much of their attention on the nation’s shadow banking system. The investment products produced by that system have funneled huge sums of cash into local asset markets, but critics say they increase leverage, create dangerous asset-liability mismatches and reduce transparency.\n\nTo learn more about the measures, read this QuickTake Q\u0026A\n\nThe tightening campaign adds to a nine-month-long effort by China’s central bank to reduce leverage by gradually raising borrowing costs. The nation’s key seven-day repo rate has climbed to about 3 percent from 2.3 percent in August, and would likely be higher if not for cash injections by the PBOC via daily open-market operations over the past month. The rate topped 12 percent during a brief shakeout in the shadow banking system in 2013.\n\nOverseas money managers including Franklin Templeton Investments and Fidelity International have applauded the latest clampdown as necessary to curb a $28 trillion debt pile that threatens China’s long-term economic stability. Yet the reception by local investors has been anything but sanguine.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite has dropped for four straight weeks to the lowest level in more than three months, even as MSCI Inc.’s gauge of global equities rallied to all-time highs. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch China Broad Market Index of government and corporate debt has lost 0.9 percent since the new regulations began impacting markets, while borrowing costs for the nation’s top-rated companies have climbed to the highest levels in two years.\n\nLast week, the selloff spread to commodities. Concerns over tighter credit conditions, combined with signs of excess supplies, sent iron ore futures in Dalian down more than 8 percent.\n\nTraders worry that higher borrowing costs will weigh on China’s metals-hungry real estate industry. Home sales in square meter terms dropped about 30 percent in the final week of April from the same period a year ago, according to data for 26 major Chinese cities tracked by CREIS, a research institute run by the country’s most popular property website.\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nThe shadow banking system is getting squeezed. The number of wealth-management products issued by Chinese lenders sank 39 percent in April from the previous month, while trust firms distributed 35 percent fewer products, according to data compilers PY Standard and Use Trust. WMPs -- popular savings vehicles that offer higher returns than deposits -- generate fees for Chinese banks while residing off their books.\n\n“What the top policy makers want is to bring lending back onto balance sheets,” said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.\n\nShen said that while the tightening measures are likely to weigh on economic growth, now is a good time for the government to act. China’s expansion unexpectedly quickened to 6.9 percent in the first quarter, giving policy makers room to tighten without jeopardizing their growth target of around 6.5 percent this year.\n\n“It’s a balancing act,” said Kenny Wen, a strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial in Hong Kong. He said authorities are likely to keep their focus on the clampdown unless the Shanghai Composite falls below the 3,000 level, a 3.3 percent decline from Friday’s close.\n\nInvestors shouldn’t assume that Chinese leaders can meet their “incompatible” objectives of maintaining an acceptable rate of economic expansion and reining in shadow banks, John-Paul Smith, a London-based emerging markets strategist at Ecstrat Ltd., wrote in an emailed report titled “The Stability Illusion” on May 3. The market reaction to tightening measures over the past month has highlighted the fragility of an economy that depends on ever-increasing amounts of debt to grow, according to Smith.\n\n“Beijing is caught between a rock and a hard place,” he wrote. “The risk is that any serious attempt to curtail the growth of financial intermediation will be the catalyst for the economy to relapse.”","author":"Sofia Horta E Costa","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T16:00:01.000Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iTXBW_El2e6U/v3/1200x801.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"VKtWu9Hg3N2G9zqBZUxkFg==\n"}

She criticized the timing of reports -- that the EU wants to stop May from leading Brexit talks, and that Britain will face a 100 billion euro ($110 billion) exit bill -- in the weeks before the June 8 vote.\n\nTheresa May Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg\n\n“Why would Jean-Claude Juncker and his team have done such a very hostile approach?” Rudd said Sunday in an interview on the BBC Radio’s Pienaar’s Politics show. “Would it not be possible to hold onto your aggression, perhaps your opening negotiating salvos, during an election period?”\n\nMay’s Tories are campaigning to return to power with a bigger parliamentary majority. She’s stressing her “strong and stable” personal leadership as the country faces the complex task of negotiating withdrawal from the EU. Conservative strategists worry voters won’t turn out for May because she’s almost 20 points ahead of her main Labour Party rivals in opinion polls and triumphed in British local elections last week.\n\nCampaign Strategy\n\nTories think the premier’s focus on the EU’s role in the U.K. election through hostile briefings about her Brexit policies will play well by rallying voters to the national cause. However, there is a risk that these clashes could damage relations between officials in London and Brussels before Brexit talks begin. EU President Donald Tusk on Thursday appealed for calm.\n\nThe argument dates back to a report in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper on April 30 that Juncker left May’s dinner shocked about her unrealistic expectations for Brexit, claiming she was living in another galaxy.\n\nIn the BBC interview, Rudd said these “very unhelpful” comments showed that the EU did want to “meddle” in the U.K. election. “It seems extraordinary to me that they would launch it during an election period,” she said.\n\nRudd’s cabinet colleague, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, said he believed the briefings were deliberately designed to damage May’s chances of being re-elected. Some EU countries “appear to think that for the EU to survive, Britain must fail,” Hunt said on BBC television’s “Andrew Marr Show.”\n\nOne Conservative lawmaker said the rhetoric from May and her ministers should be taken with a pinch of election-time salt.\n\n“I just think this is a bit of puff.

{"_id":{"$oid":"590f70ba522ffcfb9a9ac548"},"description":"A recent acquisition spree including Jet.com gives the retail giant much-needed digital chops.","title":"Can Wal-Mart’s Expensive New E-Commerce Operation Compete With Amazon?","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-05-04/can-wal-mart-s-expensive-new-e-commerce-operation-compete-with-amazon","text":"Last summer, Marc Lore, founder and chief executive officer of e-commerce startup Jet.com Inc., sat down to record a private video for the top officials of the world’s largest retailer: Wal-Mart. In the video, meant for Wal-Mart executives and board members who weren’t yet part of weeks of secret negotiations between the companies, Lore stares earnestly into the camera and shows off his Bentonville bona fides. After humblebragging about reading every annual report since 1972, he says he’s been “struck by Wal-Mart’s maniacal focus” over its storied 54-year history.\n\nBut Lore’s 40-minute presentation doesn’t hold back about the threat posed by its most fearsome and increasingly powerful archrival. “AMAZON IS DOMINATING” reads a slide on a large screen behind him. In the video, Lore presents a plan to bet Wal-Mart’s future not on e-commerce standbys such as books, electronics, and toys, but on product areas only now becoming popular online, including apparel, fresh food, and “everyday essentials” like drugstore items. “We’ll need to take the offensive, swim upstream,” Lore says. “As Sam Walton said, ‘Opportunity lies in the opposite direction.’ ”\n\nFeatured in Bloomberg Businessweek, May 8-May 14, 2017. Subscribe now Photographer: John Keatley/Redux\n\nThe video worked exceedingly well. In August, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced it would acquire Jet.com for $3.3 billion in cash and stock. It was an extraordinary sum for a 15-month-old, purple-hued website that was struggling to retain customers and is still far from making a profit. Even more astonishing, Lore and his management team in Hoboken, N.J., were put in charge of Wal-Mart’s entire domestic e-commerce operation, overseeing more than 15,000 employees in Silicon Valley, Boston, Omaha, and its home office in Arkansas. They were assigned perhaps the most urgent rescue mission in business today: Repurpose Wal-Mart’s historically underachieving internet operation to compete in the age of Amazon. “Amazon has run away with it, and Wal-Mart has not executed well,” says Scot Wingo, chief executive officer of Channel Advisor Corp., which advises brands and merchants on how to sell online. “That’s what Marc Lore has inherited.”\n\nLore’s ascendancy at Wal-Mart adds bitter personal drama that wouldn’t seem out of place on Real Housewives of New Jersey to a battle between two of the most disruptive forces in the history of retail. In 2010, Wal-Mart tried to buy Lore’s first online retail company, Quidsi Inc., which operated websites such as Diapers.com for parents and Wag.com for pet owners. But it moved too slowly and lost out to a higher bid from Amazon.com Inc. Lore then toiled at Amazon for over two years before quitting, in part out of disappointment with its refusal to invest more in Quidsi and to integrate his team into the company, according to two people close to him.\n\nJet, which he started a year after leaving Amazon, sells almost everything—books, electronics, clothes—so it was difficult to miss an element of revenge among his motivations. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO, certainly noticed. In case anyone underestimated the enmity coursing through the Lore-Bezos feud, Amazon announced in March that it was closing Quidsi, saying it didn’t see a path to profitability. Coming from the historically money-losing internet giant from Seattle, the pointed wording of the announcement was widely interpreted as an effort to undermine Lore’s credibility at Wal-Mart.\n\nLore cuts an unusual figure at the Bentonville headquarters, which he now visits once a month on a private company plane, and in the geeky hallways of San Bruno and Sunnyvale, Calif., where most of Walmart.com’s engineers work. He’s a former bank risk manager and longtime New Jersey resident who’s a fan of Bruce Springsteen and of figuring out ways to simplify the routines of daily life. He recently ditched his Tesla and uses only Uber, for example, and he visits the same sushi restaurant near his office four times a week, always ordering the salmon sashimi. He also spends time on customer-pleasing contrivances that, in the parlance of Silicon Valley, do not scale. He recently devoted a 12-hour day to recording a thousand variations of a video greeting for new Jet customers. Now when customers sign up, Lore welcomes them by their first name.\n\nHe’d like to extend Jet’s sensibility and business model to Walmart.com, the second-biggest e-commerce destination in the U.S., according to ComScore Inc. A site redesign is due this summer. (He’s thinking of recording another set of personalized introductions.) Lore also recently announced free delivery on Walmart.com for orders of more than $35, a Jet-like (and Amazon-like) tactic to give customers discounts for buying more stuff at once, so it can be shipped more efficiently in a single box. He also announced that shoppers will be able to save money on 1 million products if they order online and pick them up at one of the chain’s 4,700 U.S. stores, where it’s cheaper for the company to deliver.\n\nCrowning the entire strategy is an acquisition spree: buying middling e-commerce startups such as Shoebuy.com ($70 million), fashion retailer ModCloth ($45 million), and outdoor apparel seller MooseJaw ($51 million); installing their founders as his deputies; and selling their products on Walmart.com, where the selection still lags far behind Amazon’s. Later this spring, Lore is also likely to announce Wal-Mart’s reported $300 million acquisition of Bonobos Inc., a decade-old menswear website that offers well-fitting pants and a team of enthusiastic customer service people—Bonobos calls them “ninjas”—that wouldn’t normally be associated with a giant like Wal-Mart.\n\nWal-Mart has a lot riding on Lore. Last year he received $244 million in pay, 10 times that of his boss, Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart’s CEO. His project could determine the future of Sam Walton’s legacy and the eventual success of McMillon. It will also settle the score on whether Lore is good at building profitable e-commerce sites or just selling unprofitable ones to his competitors for piles of money.\n\n“Marc’s been given quite a bit of freedom to go get it done,” McMillon says.\n\nHow Wal-Mart Plans to Battle Amazon\n\n“The Jet.com deal is a big inflection point,” says a former Wal-Mart executive. “This is Wal-Mart’s last shot here”\n\nSince the beginning of the e-commerce era, Wal-Mart has repeatedly failed to “get it done.” In 2000 it spun out its website as a separate company and raised capital from the Silicon Valley venture firm Accel Partners. Eighteen months later, after the dot-com crash, Wal-Mart bought the operation back for an undisclosed sum. The move didn’t accomplish much of anything: Sales were disappointing—$25 million in 2000, with $100 million in clothes and other inventory left over after the holidays, according to a former senior Walmart.com executive. “We had built fulfillment for apparel, but all the demand came from electronics,” he says.\n\nThe company considered buying Gap Inc. and even Netflix Inc., the former executive says. But the decision-makers in Bentonville, intoxicated by the narcotic of constructing profitable superstores, underestimated the sublime convenience of shopping from the home or office. Many Walmart.com managers reported to Wal-Mart’s chief financial officer or vice chairman instead of the CEO, and they were pressured to show profitability. Over in Seattle, Bezos was building Amazon to gobble up market share, not generate earnings for investors.\n\nWal-Mart showed flashes of commitment to the internet later in the decade, engaging in a holiday price war on media products with Amazon in 2009 and making its unsuccessful run at Quidsi in 2010. But the next year, then-CEO Mike Duke spent $300 million to acquire a search engine, Kosmix, run by two former Amazon executives, who then created a Silicon Valley skunkworks called @WalmartLabs. They left after a year, partly in frustration over Wal-Mart’s bureaucracy.\n\nIn 2012, with Amazon’s stock booming—up 45 percent that year—Duke hired Neil Ashe, the former chief executive of the online news network CNet, to run Wal-Mart’s global internet operation. Ashe, who had no previous retailing experience, reported directly to Duke and was given a mandate to deepen Wal-Mart’s digital investments. He and his team made some progress. They rebuilt the badly outdated technology infrastructure underlying Walmart.com, introduced smartphone apps, and constructed six fulfillment complexes outfitted with state-of-the-art automation. The company’s U.S. e-commerce revenue went from an estimated $4.54 billion in 2012 to $8.03 billion in 2016, according to an analysis by Wells Fargo \u0026 Co.\n\nIt was a start. But though Amazon loomed large, Wal-Mart’s most significant fights were internal. One perennial source of tension involved prices. Amazon typically sets them using algorithms that scour the web to monitor and match the lowest number they find, which means prices can change constantly on the site. Wal-Mart sets a consistent “everyday low price” inside its stores. It’s one of the most sacrosanct brand promises in retail, practically inscribed onto holy tablets by Walton himself as a way to assure customers they won’t have to comparison-shop. The philosophy created problems on the web, though. Whenever the online price dropped below the in-store price, the merchants in Bentonville would balk. They were worried about siphoning away customers from their stores, which account for more than 97 percent of Wal-Mart’s sales.\n\nThe company was also hesitant to let outside sellers list their wares on Walmart.com. This “marketplace” idea generates half of Amazon’s unit sales. It also creates a prodigious amount of unseen internal conflict, since Amazon employees have to compete with third-party sellers who are pursuing the same buyers. But the company tolerates and even encourages the tension because choice and price competition are good for customers. Wal-Mart, accustomed to dominating its relationship with brands and showing its entire assortment in its massive stores, was reluctant to foster such competition, and it didn’t have the technological chops to support an expansive marketplace. Instead of focusing on increasing online selection, Wal-Mart kept building supercenters—more than 700 from 2010 to 2016 in the U.S. alone. Walmart.com only started adding third-party sellers in 2015, and though it now has more than 40 million products in its marketplace—Toms canvas shoes, Rebecca Minkoff satchels, and other stuff it doesn’t sell in stores—the number is small compared with the 350 million or so items available on Amazon.\n\nWhen McMillon, now 50, took over as CEO in late 2014, things began to change. He’s a sandy-haired former high school point guard who famously started at Wal-Mart as a teenager, working summers in an Arkansas stockroom. He’s also the company’s first CEO since the founder young enough to have high school-age children. McMillon has gradually come to shed the customary Wal-Mart suit and tie in favor of casual sport coats and open-collar shirts, and plays up the notion that he’s a “bit of a gadget guy.” He once bought a Kindle for his mother, and regularly invites tech luminaries such as Facebook Inc.’s Sheryl Sandberg to senior staff meetings. “I want us to sell VR before the customer is ready for it,” he says. “I keep telling our folks, ‘Buy a little and put it online, put it in 50 stores.’ Don’t tell me it won’t sell unless you try it. You gotta catch the wave. And to catch the wave, you gotta be early.”\n\nOver the past few years, Wal-Mart has notched decent numbers, including 10 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth in the U.S. and 1 percent to 2 percent increases in revenue each year. Over the holidays, its online unit recorded 29 percent sales growth over the previous year. But Amazon has been enjoying 20 percent-plus annual sales growth, and many experts say the e-commerce market could double in the next decade. The company already dominates the cities and coasts, and its next stop is the heartland, home to Wal-Mart’s customer base.\n\nMcMillon has attempted to adjust to the shifting retail landscape. He’s closed about 175 stores, reduced the size of others, and boosted pay to full- and part-time workers. He also paid a price that most analysts thought was exorbitant, if necessary, to send a clear message to everyone inside Wal-Mart about the urgency of the online effort. “The Jet.com deal is a big inflection point,” says Venky Harinarayan, one of the Kosmix founders and a former @WalmartLabs director. “This is Wal-Mart’s last shot here.”\n\nSeveral analysts share the sentiment. “Doug realized there needed to be some radical changes made, as Wal-Mart was rapidly going in the direction of close-to-defunct retailers,” says Karen Short, who studies the stock for Barclays PLC. “There was a realization that you have one shot to get that customer back in the door, so you better make sure you get it right.” Sanford C. Bernstein \u0026 Co. analyst Brandon Fletcher is reading from the same script: “This is their last window to get it right,” he says.\n\nPerhaps the same could be said of Lore. In the fall of 2015 he was seeking Jet’s fifth round of funding. The startup had already spent almost $200 million in venture capital setting up its website and blanketing cities with mailings and outdoor ads. A year after the site’s launch, critical media reports suggested Jet wasn’t gaining traction with customers, framing the company as an example of Silicon Valley profligacy. The accounts weren’t altogether off-base; according to Second Measure, a company that analyzes credit card data, among a sample of 8,000 customers who joined Jet.com that October, fewer than 400 were still buying from the site six months later.\n\nPublicly, Lore played it cool. Privately, he was a wreck. He says he pulled two straight all-nighters while he was closing the round. He was so exhausted on one red-eye flight, he vomited all over his coach-class airplane seat. He eventually succeeded, though, raising $500 million, at a $1 billion valuation, from Fidelity International, Bain Capital, Google Ventures, and Alibaba Group Holding. “That round was definitely stressful,” he says. “We had less than four weeks of cash left in the bank when we finally closed it.”\n\nLore was making the same risky bet that Bezos had years before. E-commerce businesses that start out looking frail can generate healthy amounts of cash if they make it past infancy. And though it wasn’t working yet, Lore argued that Jet’s “smart cart” system—which gives customers opportunities to save money when they buy multiple items at once or agree to a longer delivery time—would eventually entice a price-conscious swath of Middle America. “We weren’t seeing the benefits of it because we had not yet reached scale,” Lore says. “But the model was absolutely viable. I think the market is massive, and even a small share of a trillion-dollar [retail industry] is a pretty big business.”\n\nIn early 2016, with Jet churning through its new cash, one of the startup’s board members used that pitch on Wal-Mart, hoping to get Lore an introduction to McMillon. It worked, and Lore flew out for a meeting in Bentonville. What started out as a preliminary discussion about an investment in Jet flowered quickly into a corporate bromance. In June, McMillon visited Jet’s offices in Hoboken, wearing a brand-appropriate purple shirt. Lore says they spent considerable time at a whiteboard, sketching out a shared future: “We just sort of immediately saw eye to eye on what needed to be done.” It’s unclear if harps played in the background.\n\nThey both needed the partnership: McMillon to send up a flare for employees and investors about the importance of Wal-Mart’s online efforts, and Lore to pay off his backers and escape the fundraising circuit, where he’d spent about half his time over the previous two years. McMillon also came away with a handy pitch for Wal-Mart shareholders who might have blanched over the purchase price—that the company’s founder himself would have loved Jet.com. “The Jet concept of sharing savings with customers is a very Sam Walton-like idea,” says Richard Cook, co-manager of the Cook \u0026 Bynum Fund, which owns Wal-Mart stock. “You will help us lower costs, and we will share that savings with you.”\n\nMcMillon and Lore structured the Jet deal differently from Amazon’s purchase of Quidsi. Lore took over Wal-Mart’s entire e-commerce business in the U.S. and combined the Jet and Walmart.com teams, though he continues to run them as separate websites.\n\nIn January, hoping to streamline the two companies’ digital strategies, Lore eliminated 200 jobs in Silicon Valley and created a new class of so-called category specialists, each of whom oversees a narrow product area, such as food-storage bags or cribs, on both sites. He also changed these employees’ incentive structure. Instead of evaluating them entirely on quarterly profit and loss, as Wal-Mart managers have been judged in the past, Lore introduced five bellwethers related to the customer experience, such as whether products are in stock, how easily they can be found on the site, and how quickly they’re delivered.\n\nLore says he enjoys a kind of autonomy at Wal-Mart that he never had inside Amazon—about as close to a criticism of his former employer as he’ll make. “When you give people all the information and you trust them and keep everything fair,” he says, “people have room to run and to be empowered.”\n\nThe Wal-Mart fulfillment center in Bethlehem, Pa., is a marvel of 21st century retail. It’s an absurdly vast 1.2 million square feet, with products stacked 40 feet high on metal shelves that extend in both directions nearly as far as the eye can see. Quotes from Sam Walton—“To succeed, stay in front of change”—pepper the walls. The prevailing sensation in the warehouse is one of sound: The drone of conveyor belts and computer-controlled chutes threaded through the facility blends with a symphony of beeps from forklifts, producing an orchestral hum that drowns out the actual music playing on distant overhead loudspeakers. Flying along those belts at 8 mph is the bounty of modern capitalism: dog treats, underwear, Nintendo Switch controllers, Campbell’s cream of chicken soup. “If Wal-Mart sells it, we fulfill it here,” says David Tarnosky, the center’s general manager.\n\nAlthough the fulfillment complex and its five cohorts were built by Lore’s predecessor, they’re key to Wal-Mart’s renewed bid for relevance. They allow the company to ship its most popular products anywhere in the country within two days on the ground or one by air, down from a week five years ago. These are table stakes in the pricey poker game that is contemporary e-commerce.\n\nAt one end of the facility, among rows of yellow-safety-vest-wearing packers earning about $14 an hour, another aspect of the strategy reveals itself. In February, in one of his first acts in his new role, Lore scrapped Wal-Mart’s two-year-old Amazon Prime copycat, called ShippingPass, and instead offered free two-day shipping on any order of more than $35. (In a rare act of following a competitor, Amazon dropped its free-shipping minimum purchase from $49 to $35 for non-Prime members.) The free-shipping gambit has translated into boxes packed to the brim with jumbles of baby wipes, paper towels, and other everyday items. The sight should come as a relief to the company’s accounting department. “Shipping one unit is ex-pen-sive,” McMillon says, drawing out the word. “It costs five bucks to ship one item, seven bucks to ship seven. So when you aggregate volume on the supply side, the economics change in your favor.”\n\nHe contends that you can’t ship items individually and make money, but that may not be entirely true. Amazon, with its vaster scale and hyperefficient fulfillment centers, has trained consumers to order a single product whenever they need it. Wal-Mart may never get there, but it has other advantages, which Lore plans to exploit. The main one is the cost efficiency produced by its 4,700 stores, hundreds of distribution centers, and 6,200 trucks, which prowl the country bearing the company slogan, “Save Money. Live Better.” Wal-Mart has spent decades ensuring it can ship products to its stores more cheaply than any other retailer, which also means it can do so more cheaply than sending them directly to customer’s homes. Lore wants to entice shoppers to stores with discounts and then lure them inside to pick up jumbo packs of bottled water, bags of charcoal, and other products, where Wal-Mart’s prices can’t be beat. To do so he’s experimenting with a 16-foot-tall octagonal orange “pickup tower” code-named Rapunzel—a vending machine that sits inside a store, holds as many as 300 orders, and spits the right one out when a customer feeds info into a touchscreen.\n\nHe’s also prioritizing groceries. Wal-Mart, the country’s leader in this category, allows grocery pickup from 600 locations and plans to add an additional 525 this year. “If Wal-Mart can translate that food trip to the digital realm, they’re in a good spot,” says Robin Sherk, an analyst at Kantar. “For them, winning online grocery is mission-critical.”\n\n“Marc’s been given quite a bit of freedom to go get it done,” McMillon says of Lore (right), who’s in charge of Wal-Mart’s entire e-commerce operation in the U.S. Photographer: Meredith Jenks for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFinally, Lore hopes to rip out the barriers between the store and the e-commerce business that have stymied Walmart.com in the past. For example, he’s expanding a service called Easy Reorder: Everything you buy with a credit card at a Wal-Mart store will show up in your online account, ready to be replenished with one click. It’ll almost certainly hurt store traffic in favor of online sales, but Lore says that shouldn’t matter: “If you don’t want to let another business cannibalize your customer, you have to let them shop whatever way they want to.”\n\nOf course, Wal-Mart’s biggest challenge is that its primary rival isn’t standing still. An estimated half of all U.S. households subscribe to Amazon Prime, according to a report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. And Amazon currently takes more than $5 out of every $10 spent buying stuff online, says Macquarie Research. Its market value, buoyed by its cloud-computing business, is now around twice Wal-Mart’s. In Seattle, Amazon is also trying out concepts, such as the Amazon Go store, where customers are automatically charged for items they pick from shelves without going through a checkout line, and a hybrid supermarket-and-pickup center for people who order groceries online. All of this stands to eat into Wal-Mart’s advantages.\n\nThere are other challenges. Can Wal-Mart translate its domestic progress overseas, particularly in the fast-moving markets of China and India, currently outside Lore’s domain? And can Lore, a veteran of grow-at-all-cost startups, find long-term profits in Walmart.com to satisfy the company’s vocal investors?\n\nLore doesn’t seem overly anxious about that last issue. Over lunch, he shares a story about his teenage daughter, who’s started an online sticker-selling business whose proceeds go to philanthropies fighting celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder. When his daughter recently told him she was making money, Lore says, he was shocked. “How are you profitable?” he asked her.\n\n“Well, Dad, it’s easy,” she replied. “You just make sure your revenues are higher than your expenses.”\n\n“Oh,” Lore recalls saying. “I never really thought about it that way.”\n\nOne wonders what Sam Walton would make of that.\n\n\n\n—With Molly Smith","author":"Brad Stone, Matthew Boyle","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-04T08:00:07.746Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7JgJgBXn0_A/v0/-1x-1.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"YP0CIgdlEaLPEfpd/2mmnQ==\n"}

A record 12% of voters cast a blank or \"spoiled\" ballot.\n\nMacron's expected margin of victory was bigger than the gap shown by pre-election polls, which had projected a Macron victory by around 20 points.\n\n\"A new page in our long history this evening. I would like it to be one of hope and of confidence rediscovered,\" the Macron campaign said in a statement.\n\nA former investment banker, Macron served for two years under President François Hollande as Minister of Economy, Industry, and Digital Data, but had never held elected office. He only truly entered the public discourse when he rebelled against Hollande's socialist party and ran as an independent presidential candidate for his En Marche! (Onwards!) movement.\n\nMacron has expressed pro-businesses and pro-EU views. He built a reputation with his \"Macron Law,\" a controversial reform bill that allowed, among other things, longer retail hours on Sunday.\n\nThe 48-year-old Le Pen said she called Macron to congratulate him and concede the election. Shortly after polls closed, Le Pen spoke to supporters, pledging a \"profound reform\" of her party, the National Front, in an effort to create \"a new political force.\" Some have speculated that Le Pen may attempt to rename or rebrand the party to further separate it from past allegations of racism and anti-Semitism.\n\n\"Our patriotic and republican alliance will be the primary force of opposition to the programme of the new president,\" Le Pen said on Sunday.\n\nLe Pen is famed for her hardline anti-immigration views and opposition to the European Union. She has taken steps to soften the inflammatory image of the National Front her father founded, and she gained significant support among younger voters who found her antiestablishment and pro-French-worker stances appealing.\n\nMacron will be inaugurated on May 14, when Hollande is expected to step down.\n\nDespite Le Pen's loss, the election marked a record result for National Front. Le Pen's 35% was almost twice that of her father, Jean-Marie, who lost to Jacques Chirac in a presidential run-off in 2002.\n\nMacron must now work to win a majority for his En Marche! party in next month's parliamentary elections. The movement is just about one year old and will have to field hundreds of candidates in the elections.\n\nLe Pen told supporters to look ahead to the parliamentary elections and pledged to be the main voice of opposition to Macron's movement.\n\nHollande released a statement via Twitter, saying that he had called Macron to congratulate him and \"expressed all my best wishes for the success of our country.\"\n\nFrance's prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve released a statement congratulating Macron on his win, saying that voters rejected the \"fatal project of the extreme right\" and upheld the values of France.\n\n[Communiqué] Election présidentielle pic.twitter.com/T4BXBSy0jJ — Bernard Cazeneuve (@BCazeneuve) May 7, 2017\n\nCongratulations from other European leaders also poured in quickly.

In the first quarter of 2017, industry-wide same-store sales dropped 1.1%, while traffic fell 3.4%, according to Nation's Restaurant News. In the last year, companies operating chains such as Logan's Roadhouse and Souplantation have filed for bankruptcy. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Ignite Restaurant Group — which runs Joe’s Crab Shack and Brick House Tavern — could do the same as early as next week.\n\nAs traffic drops, restaurant chains are increasingly looking to delivery as a solution.\n\nMcDonald's is testing delivery through UberEats in multiple cities across the US, with the most recent trial run in Pittsburgh announced last week. On Monday, Wendy's launched delivery at 135 locations in Ohio. And, Panera Bread is rolling out delivery at 35 to 40% of its locations this year, the company announced in January.\n\nDelivery is especially crucial for casual dining, or sit-down, restaurant chains, which have been hit hardest by the restaurant recession.\n\n\"The only part of casual dining that’s growing right now is the off premise side,\" said Bonnie Riggs, foodservice industry analyst for NPD, recently told Nation's Restaurant News.\n\nCheesecake Factory announced earlier this year it is expanding delivery to half of its 194 US locations through DoorDash, a third party delivery service. T.G.I. Fridays, Chili's, and Maggiano's are all now on Grubhub, and Buffalo Wild Wings and Red Robin are testing the service. Outback Steakhouse is using both third-party services and building its own delivery service.\n\nWhile delivery is clearly a compelling option to offer, it isn't a simple service for restaurants to add. Customers often spend less when ordering delivery, especially at casual dining chains that rely on alcohol orders to drive sales. In-house delivery means added complexities, paying drivers, and additional insurance costs. Using a third-party means losing control over the food's quality.\n\nTaco Bell's CEO Brian Niccol told Business Insider that delivery is customers' No. 1 demand at the chain. Despite several tests, the Mexican fast-food chain hasn't figured out a way to make the service work.\n\n\"The third party folks, the aggregators — they're just not fast enough,\" Niccol said.\n\nHowever, as customers' demand for convenience grows, chains are increasingly going to have to invest in delivery — or be beaten by restaurants that have.","author":"Kate Taylor","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T14:36:00.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/590cc6c652b5d86d418b4677-1190-625/chains-are-banking-on-this-new-strategy-to-combat-the-restaurant-apocalypse.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"q1IPYR+0+uRmsDC662nQQg==\n"}

The key of having a continuous coverage provision is to make sure that people stay covered and they move from one plan to the next if they want to. It's kind of like waiting until your house is on fire to then buy your homeowner's insurance. You want to make sure that people stay covered to keep the cost down.\"\n\nStephanopoulos also pressed the speaker to answer critics who asserted that the bill unfairly benefited the wealthy by rolling back the taxes on high income earners that helped fund the Affordable Care Act, the law better known as Obamacare.\n\nThe ABC anchor said the AHCA cuts $900 million in taxes for individuals who earn over $200,000 annually, while also cutting $1 trillion in subsidies for Medicaid.\n\n\"Most of benefits go to millionaires,\" Stephanopoulos said.\n\nRyan characterized the bill as a \"a rescue operation,\" touting hypothetical benefits of block-granting Medicaid, which gives states a lump sum rather than a per-person amount.\n\n\"We're giving states the ability to run their own Medicaid program,\" Ryan said, arguing that block-granting Medicaid was \"hardly draconian.\"\n\n\"So, you don't think anyone will be hurt when you're taking $880 billion out of the system?\" Stephanopoulos asked.\n\n\n\n\"No I don't, because I think the micro-management of Medicaid by the federal government,\" Ryan replied. \"The Medicaid system isn't working. Doctors aren't taking Medicaid, hospitals can't survive with Medicaid alone. So by giving the states the ability to customize their Medicaid population their program to work for them.\"\n\nThough Ryan defended the House plan, he acknowledged that the Senate version is likely to differ significantly.\n\nSeveral top Republicans in the senate have voiced skepticism of the House plan, which they say places too many costs on older, poorer Americans and would burden some states with high healthcare costs.

That was my answer for a long time.\n\nNow we’ve gotten into the age of social networks, I think the last couple of years have made a lot of people rethink. So having spent two decades trying to keep the Web open, keep it neutral, assuming that, if humanity has an open and neutral Web, then it will build wonderful things with it, like Wikipedia, etc. Now we’ve realized, actually, it might not. It depends what sort of system technically you build on the Web when you build something like a social networking system.\n\nNow, depending on how you design it, it can be lent to a more constructive argument or a less constructive argument. It can be lent to a propagation of wonderful sort or the propagation of hatred.\n\nDöpfner: If you were to draw a line through the World Wide Web and digitalization today, would it be more good or more bad?\n\nBerners-Lee: Net, more good.\n\nDöpfner: Let’s go back to the ’80s when you worked in Geneva and, step by step, you came up with this groundbreaking innovation. How did it happen?\n\nBerners-Lee: Now you’re a journalist, and I’m an inventor, and journalists always ask inventors about the way we came up with it.\n\nDöpfner: Some of the biggest inventions happen when scientists are looking for something completely different.\n\nBerners-Lee: Yeah, some of those are very interesting.\n\nDöpfner: Viagra was invented against high blood pressure.\n\nBerners-Lee: Exactly. In this case, no. I had been working on problems like that for years and years and years, and I had worked on text formatting programs, and I had worked on data transition programs, and I’d worked on operating systems, and I’d worked on user interfaces.\n\nEverywhere I’d gone, I found myself frustrated by the fact that anything they gave you which was printed for a meeting, there’d always be a disc copy somewhere. So somewhere, there would be a copy of this thing going round and round on a computer, and that computer was probably connected indirectly or directly to the Internet, but once I had the piece of paper, I couldn’t actually search electronically without jumping through completely different hoops for each system.\n\nSo the lack of interoperability between all the systems for handling information was frustrating. CERN was a great place. It was full of wonderful people, full of wonderful different ideas, and it was very diverse. So in a way, it had that problem of diversity and to perhaps a greater extent than most places. I wanted to solve the problem of lack of interoperability. I’d seen a lot of people who had actually tried to do that by building one single system, and whenever they’d done the centralized approach, they’d failed because they would decide to use the IBM mainframe. So I realized that the ideal would be actually to leave people using their existing systems.\n\nDöpfner: Could you describe a little bit how long it took to really develop it and how many people had you involved? Was it a big team, or was it basically done in splendid isolation?\n\nBerners-Lee: Well, what took a long time was getting the space to be able to work on it because CERN didn’t make general-purpose software. So I didn’t get any official go-ahead at all. Well, my boss Mike Sendall, in fact, he had a twinkle in his eye, and he found an excuse for me to do it. I’d given him a memo describing it, and I’d also said that I was really interested in getting a NeXT machine. The NeXT was a box. It was the thing that Steve Jobs did when he left Apple. So that was in itself a really interesting creative thing, and he developed that for people to be able to communicate. So Mike said, \"Okay. You’re interested in the NeXT. Let’s just get one. We need to develop something just to test the NeXT box.“ So with a big wink, he says, \"Why don’t you just try it out, that hypertext thing you were talking about or something like that?\"\n\nSo the NeXT arrived in 1990 in September. I started working in October. I had the Web working in the end of November, in fact after a couple of months really developing it.\n\nDöpfner: Sorry, from October to November, that would be just two months?\n\nBerners-Lee: Yep.\n\nDöpfner: That was it?\n\nBerners-Lee: That was it, it was a really good development platform.\n\nDöpfner: How high was the budget?\n\nBerners-Lee: Zero. It was all unofficial, zero budget, but Mike allowed my 20 percent time to expand to 100 percent time.\n\nDöpfner: That was crucial?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: That was crucial. I didn’t get back that memo that I gave him until after he died. His wife Peggy found it, and she found that he’s written on the top corner in a pencil, \"Vague, but exciting.\"\n\nDöpfner: That’s wonderful.\n\nBerners-Lee: It was an exponential progress. Over the first year, it grew. The number of hits on our server, my personal server, went up by a factor of 10. The next year, they went up by 10. The following year, they went up by 10. So it was linear if you kept it on a scale of powers of 10.\n\nIt was exciting, of course, because something that grows that fast was unusual at that point. One crisis was a challenge with the Gopher project. The University of Minnesota had a project which was a campus-wide information system quite like the Web. It worked on the Internet. It didn’t have exactly links, but it was competing, and in fact, it was more popular than the World Wide Web.\n\nAt the time, the World Wide Web was increasing exponentially, and the Gopher project was increasing exponentially, and it was winning. Then there was a point when the University of Minnesota said, \"Maybe it won’t be royalty free. Maybe we won’t charge. Only the service, we won’t charge academics, only businesses, but if you’re a business, not now, but later, and a very small amount, but we might possibly reserve the right to charge for the system in the future.\" That was it. That was the end of Gopher on the Internet.\n\nSo that was a big lesson. That was an opportunity in that the people wanted to know. They demanded a statement from CERN. So eventually, it was after 18 months of the project start, and on April 30th, 1993, CERN made that commitment to a royalty free license. Ten years later, all the members of the Web Consortium, all the industry members, also made a similar commitment to keep it patent free. So that was, in a way, the crisis of the early Web. If anybody’d ended up charging royalties for it, that would’ve just settled it.\n\nDöpfner: Of course, you as an inventor had to be passionate about it. How about the other people in the institute or the people that were working with you? Did they understand the vision, or was there also a lot of opposition or criticism?\n\nBerners-Lee: There was a lot of opposition because a lot of people did not understand what it would be like, and it’s really difficult to explain to millennials now why they couldn’t understand.\n\nDöpfner: It´s so obvious. But only in retrospect.\n\nBerners-Lee: But then I’d show them a hypertext page, and I click on a link, and I go to another hypertext page. They say, „Big deal. You’ve got two hypertext pages.“ So what would happen is I would give a talk to a group of people, in an auditorium with 30 or 40 people, and most of the people would sort of nod and think another documentation system or something, but two or three people, you’d see their eyes crack. They’d think, „If everybody did this, this would be really neat.“ So they would come afterwards. After the questions, they’d come up and say, „Where do we get the software? Can we help?“\n\nAnd so it spread. I suppose it spread in three dimensions. It spread to people who were interested in hypertext, which was an obscure form of backwater of the computing space, but there were some people who were interested in hypertext. So they were interested. I developed it on the NeXT, which was really rare. So people who had NeXT machines, they were able to download the thing over the Internet. And of course, physicists, I really had to try to make it appeal to this specific group.\n\nDöpfner: Do you think that CERN was particularly privileged for such an invention, or could that have happened anywhere else?\n\nBerners-Lee: I think it in a way could’ve happened anywhere else, but CERN was in a way a great place to try it out because it had...\n\nDöpfner: ... experimental culture?\n\nBerners-Lee: Yes there was. It had people who had the latest workstations on their desks because CERN would buy very powerful workstations with nice screens for doing the physics. So they ended up being useful to the World Wide Web.\n\nBecause it didn’t have a strong hierarchy, it had people from different universities, different countries, those people came. So it was sort of a bit of a small-scale model of the rest of the world in its diversity, a lot of cultures, lots of different computer systems. So it had sort of the frustration of these incompatibilities.\n\nIf it had been a big company, if it had been something like General Motors, then the manager would’ve said, „All right. We’re going to have a big central documentation system by next Thursday, and everybody will use it.“ And that’s the end of the story. So it takes something very diverse.\n\nDöpfner: Is there any advice that you could give to young people who have crazy ideas, who want to invent something great?\n\nBerners-Lee: Well, CERN was a fortuitous place to be, but also, 1989 was a fortuitous time. The Internet was just coming. Here in Berlin, across a lot of the world, it was a time of massive change. The communities, the universities were getting actually connected together. I benefited from the work that Internet designers had done in building it as an open platform. Also, building it as a platform, I didn’t have to ask permission to use.\n\nSo that’s true also of the Web. You don’t have to ask permission. If somebody out there has a brilliant idea, you can just go and think of a website you’d like to build. The way the Web works is you just get a computer, plug it into the Internet, and design what the hell crazy website you like.\n\nYou can be very creative. Really, it’s a challenge. If you’ve ever been to a website and felt that you could do better, well, you can. Go for it. It’s the openness, the permission of space.\n\nDöpfner: Why did you decide not to patent your invention?\n\nBerners-Lee: I knew from the beginning the goal was always to have one Web. If there was any commercial, if there were any royalties charged by whoever it was, then that company then would’ve become one of the Webs. Other companies would’ve immediately made incompatible versions of it. They would’ve built their own patents and own technology.\n\nMathias Döpfner: It could never get to a global standard.\n\nBerners-Lee: I’d never get to the global standard. I wouldn’t get that key.\n\nDöpfner: So it was not a moral decision at all. It was just very logical, pragmatic...\n\nBerners-Lee: It was a hard-nosed pragmatic decision, yes.\n\nDöpfner: Did you ever think about how the Internet would look today without the World Wide Web? Perhaps as a kind of military tool for very few people?\n\nBerners-Lee: We can never know.\n\nDöpfner: But would you agree that, basically, the World Wide Web transformed the basic invention of the Internet into a mass market success?\n\nBerners-Lee: Well, the Internet allowed any two computers to communicate. The World Wide Web provided an information space for humanity to be connected. Because it was easy enough for ordinary people to use, it then pushed the Internet to people who in the geeky days would never have thought about buying a computer.\n\nYou can remember what it was like with America Online, for example, perhaps the most successful of the walled gardens, but there were lots of them. There were dial-up bulletin boards, I think like Prodigy and Delphi, and then AOL was one.\n\nEach of those tried to be the single place that you go to for everything. When the Web came along, AOL got into trouble to a certain extent, first, they tried to pretend that the Web was a small thing and really part of AOL. Then people realized that AOL is part of the Web. However much effort they put into the walled garden, it could never compete with the crazy creativity.\n\nDöpfner: Before we go to the walled gardens of today: is it actually true that you were advised not to call it the World Wide Web because www is so difficult to pronounce in the English and French language?\n\nBerners-Lee: I was certainly advised. People complained. WW was too much of a mouthful, but it was useful. Nobody else had thought of WWW, and it was unique. So we could count the number of Web servers, for example, just by counting the number of computers called www.\n\nMathias Döpfner: Did you consider any alternatives for the branding of this idea?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: I considered a few, well, Mine of Information. I called it The Information Mine because Mine of Information just in English is colloquial, conveys richness of things, of contents, but The Information Mine is TIM, which was a little bit too egocentric.\n\nDöpfner: When the project was finished, did you realize that you developed something very big or was it more like: “this was an interesting project?”\n\nBerners-Lee: This is still an interesting project. What are all the things we have to do to keep this project on track? So the phases, there’s never been a next. There’s never been, \"Okay. The World Wide Web is now stable.\"\n\nDöpfner: How close are we today to your original vision of it, and how far are we away from that?\n\nBerners-Lee: Well, of course, the original vision didn’t foresee that the search algorithms would become so good. When people gave talks about the Web initially, the search engines were the butt of all the jokes because their results were terrible. But then the Google guys discovered this algorithm which looked at the links instead of the words.\n\nDöpfner: When did you meet the Google boys first?\n\nBerners-Lee: I met Larry Page back a few years ago.\n\nMathias Döpfner: But not in the early days. They didn’t consult you?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: No, not at all. During those boom days, nobody had time to talk to anybody. Lots of things have happened that I could never have imagined. For example, the first maps that Steve Putz of Xerox PARC made were really clunky. You had to click to move the app, the whole thing. Then later on, you could switch the maps around. Now people using an online map find it so easy, and they’re so powerful, and they know when the buses run and everything. So we’ve come a huge long way.\n\nDöpfner: What is the best thing so far that you have seen happening with and because of the World Wide Web and what is the worst?\n\nBerners-Lee: I don’t put things in order.\n\nDöpfner: If you don’t put it in order, is there any moment where you really had the feeling, \"Oh my God, what they did, they simply abused my invention?\"\n\nBerners-Lee: One example of the system not really working as designed was the interaction between the for-pay advertising system and political system last year when these guys in Veles, Macedonia, just had websites where they were trying to attract traffic. They were using the Google Ad system. So Google would financially reward them very quickly if they could get more people to follow the links and click on more links.\n\nSo these people during the election season, they ended up finding that, if you just wanted to tweet out a headline and get somebody to click on it, then the US election is definitely a great topic.\n\nThen the Google Ad system trained them just like you train a dog. In a way, it just gave them more money for the things which were more clickable. So they learned that untruth was more clickable than truth.\n\nDöpfner: I think it was found out that Uber is tracking your movements not only while you are using the product, but they identify you or rather your mobile phone by means of a sort of digital fingerprint even if you deleted the app at some point.\n\nIs that something where you’d say, \"Well, we should have expected that because everything that is doable will be done, and that’s all fine?\"\n\nBerners-Lee: Absolutely not. No, I’m not one of those people. You might find Eric Schmidt, who famously says that privacy is over, get over it, but actually, no, I’m not one of those people. I believe that privacy is really fundamental to all.\n\nDöpfner: Or they say that he who has nothing to hide has nothing to fear.\n\nBerners-Lee: Absolutely. That attitude is very sinister, but also, the idea that we have privacy only for things which we feel guilty about. We have privacy. Any company has things it discusses within the company. That’s how it functions. It can plan its new products. It can look at its successes and failures. You have groups within the company as well which don’t share things with the other groups.\n\nDöpfner: I think it’s an element of a free society that you have the freedom to define – within the framework of legality – what you want to share and what you don’t want to share within the framework of legality. If that is defined by other people, by political authorities, or by companies, actually, I think it is changing our model of free democracies.\n\nBerners-Lee: Yes, exactly.\n\nDöpfner: Would you agree that total transparency can lead to totalitarianism?\n\nBerners-Lee: Well, that’s too simplistic. I don’t like to use the word transparency for that. If you’re having a meeting about how Berlin is going to fix the holes in the road and how much money should be spent on this, that should be public. It’s information by the public, for the public. The public is paying for it. So there is a duty of transparency. You don’t have the right to keep that private.\n\nI’m very much in favor of privacy. I think that Germany has been a great leader for the rest of the world in that case and so should hang in there. There have been times when Germany has led the EU into insisting on privacy throughout the European Union, and that’s been beneficial for everybody.\n\nDöpfner: In a way, you could say there have been two iconic and culture-defining experiences in America and in Europe regarding privacy. In Europe, it’s the Holocaust. It is an example how total transparency was used an abused by the Nazis. They knew who was Jewish, where which Jews were living, what they did und thought. They registered and tracked each and every one of them, they even tattooed a number on their arms before putting them in a concentration camp. That was unlimited control, totalitarian transparency.\n\nIn contrast, the United States – their traumatic experience is 9/11. After 9/11, in order to avoid terrorism of that kind, the most efficient way was total transparency. You know everything about your potential enemies, which means you know everything about your own population. You track everything. You spy on everything because that is considered to be the best way to avoid terrorism and ensure security. So it may be that these two traumatic experiences led to very different conclusions. Here is a deeply rooted sensitivity for too much transparency, there it cannot be enough transparency.\n\nHow do you experience these differences in mentality when talking to your colleagues in England and in the Silicon Valley?\n\nBerners-Lee: So it is interesting to live half and half. When it came to open data, both the UK and the US were pretty good leaders. When it comes to privacy, then I think, to a certain extent, as I said, Europe has done better, but there are strong privacy guarantees in the States. The strongest things are the things that are constitutionally based.\n\nThe most interesting example recently, when a loudspeaker manufacturer was taken to court, because when you listen to the speaker, if you use Spotify on your phone, you could hand off the Spotify playlist to that speaker using Spotify Connect, and then the speaker would then play it by itself. So the speaker would know which songs you were playing, and the speaker was reporting the songs to Bose, the manufacturer of the loudspeaker.\n\nSo we noticed it. I tweeted about it. I don’t normally read the terms and conditions at all, but for the Bose speaker, I thought, \"Why do I have to get an account at Bose just to use a loudspeaker?\" And it turns out that they were monitoring them.\n\nSo that is an example. They were successfully sued under wiretap laws, and they appealed to a high court, and they lost. So basically, the idea that you can do what Uber does, I think that the wiretap law is basically the interception of messages, and the interception of data is illegal in the States.\n\nDöpfner: Some peope might be surprised, mainly because you can hardly be blamed for being anti-progress or anti-technology. It’s very difficult to say who should decide those questions of anonymity and accountability. Is it the company? Is it the legal system of a market, a country? I think that these developments are posing a whole set of completely new questions.\n\nBerners-Lee: I think, by the way, that whereas initially it might be an AI, and then it may be the company, at the end of the day, the arbiter has to be the court system.\n\nDöpfner: Right. But was does that mean for fake news?\n\nBerners-Lee: What’s the fake news? How do they define fake news in this case?\n\nDöpfner: Well, that’s already where the problem starts. That means that, in the end, Facebook or another social media platform can define what fake news is, and I think it should always be the prosecutor and not a private company. Facebook should be a neutral platform. People exchange all kinds of things, good and bad, truth and lies. However, only if something is illegal, the prosecutor should intervene. If Facebook with its almost two billion users – ushered by well-intentioned politicians – morphs into a universal media monopoly making editorial decisions and even judging on who gets to read what, then we have a problem. And it is exacerbated if that happens in a closed system.\n\nBerners-Lee: Let’s talk first about a monopoly and then about data. We know about monopolies. Before the Web, there was the telephone system. A large number of countries had monopolies because that’s the way they decided to do the telephone system.\n\nIt did mean that, if you were a telephone engineer and you had a brilliant idea and you weren’t working for the telephone company, you were out of luck because the telephone company was the only entity who’s allowed to sell telephones. But then they changed that and increased the amount of competition. Competition was improved. AT\u0026T was broken up.\n\nThere was AOL, of course, which was pretty much a monopoly pre-Web. When the Web started, people were worried Netscape was far and away the most popular browser. So there was the concern that the company Netscape had potentially complete control over the whole Web until, one day, people turned around and realized that, actually, no, Microsoft not only has a dominant browser, but they have the operating system, and they’ve locked them together. So it’s worse. Why were they ever worried about it? Bring Netscape back in.\n\nSo then they were worried about Microsoft, and they continued to be worried about Microsoft as being the dominant software player until, suddenly, they realized they weren’t worried about Microsoft anymore because they realized, no, it doesn’t matter which browser you use if you always go to the same search engine. So they worried about Google. Some, still worry about Google, but then some, they stopped worrying about Google because, actually, what people do is they Google Facebook, and they go to Facebook, and they spend the entire day on Facebook.\n\nDöpfner: But that’s exactly the point.\n\nBerners-Lee: There have always been monopolies. They have always been an issue. They’ve always been a concern. They have not always been permanent.\n\nDöpfner: No, almost no monopoly in the history of business has been permanent. That’s why you could say we shouldn’t worry about monopolies because they will always be disrupted by other big aggressive players. In the long run, neither Standard Oil nor Bell Telephone Company survived as monopolies. Most of the monopolies were disrupted by competition, but in some cases, the regulator could help and had to help.\n\nPeter Thiel wrote that book on monopolies with an underlying theory or main theory that monopolies are for winners, and competition is for losers. Where is the balance? What should the regulator do in dealing with monopolies, basically leave it up entirely to the market because the market will resolve it in the long run, or restrict the dominant positions of certain players?\n\nBerners-Lee: I think the antitrust system is really important. The market works while there’s a mix of people, while there’s a mix of big players and small players all in the same market. The moment that mix is gone, then the market’s not functioning anymore.\n\nDöpfner: Is there a particular challenge for the digital world because of the effects of the network economy? There is that book by the famous Chief Economist of Google, Hal Varian, who used to be an independent professor and wrote a book about the network economy, where he basically proved that, in the digital world, you use or abuse your existing monopoly in order to create new monopolies because the old monopoly’s going to be disrupted. But if you let a player go that way too long, then the combination of monopolies with a search algorithm, with a browser, with devices and everything, can be simply too dominant. By the way: It’s funny that this principle has been implemented very systematically by Google.\n\nBerners-Lee: I think one of the nice things about the digital world is the fact that the Internet was net neutral. The net was built as a neutral space without attitude. That’s why it has “permissionless”. That’s why I could build the WWW product on top of it.\n\nSo the markets for the websites, the markets for content, the wide markets for whatever you build on top of the Web have been independent of the market for connectivity.\n\nSo you could choose to get fiber at your house from a competing market without that affecting which movies you can watch tonight, so different from the American paid cable system, which the net replaced.\n\nSo net neutrality has been a really, really important part of these new markets, but you can’t join them together. You shouldn’t bundle together the content.\n\nDöpfner: Are you advocating net neutrality without exception?\n\nBerners-Lee: Yes. It’s been really important, and it is very important now. We should fight for it whenever it’s threatened, as it is currently under threat .\n\nDöpfner: Again: How about the whole fake news phenomenon? How should society deal with that? Should publishers help Facebook to correct their fake news stories, or is it basically more about media education, that people should learn that not everything that is distributed on a social media platform is necessarily true?\n\nBerners-Lee: I think we have to be very scientific and look at how these systems interact. The Macedonian websites we talked about earlier generated ad revenue by making up things about the US election, and affected that election even though their motivation was not at all political, only commercial. The ad network trained them that lies can generate more revenue than truth. As a system engineer, I look at that and say, \"Well, now, something’s broken here.\" So one of the possibilities is for Google at that point to tweak the way they reimburse people not just on the clicks, but on some other function.\n\nDöpfner: So you could say the fact that Facebook is incentivizing people to distribute bad content, fake news, has to be changed in the very interest of the social media platform.\n\nBerners-Lee: The guys in Veles, Macedonia, they were indepenent , they were not on Facebook. They were only on websites. They pointed at them with Twitter. So it wasn’t a Facebook phenomenon.\n\nThere’s a separate Facebook phenomenon which I’m told was an important factor in the election. That is targeted advertising. Targeted advertising on social networks is very effective. There’s a blog. He claimed that what they did was divided the entire American voting population into 32 different subtypes, like Myers-Briggs, different sorts of people, different demographics, and so they could then send targeted information.\n\nSo to one group with children, you’d say, \"Our candidate is going to fight for education.\" Then there’s a group without children, and they can say, \"Our candidate is going to save money by cutting down education\"“ Because it’s targeted advertising, it’s not public so nobody can check.\n\nSo one simple rule could be that you could say, actually, targeted advertising by political bodies is not democratic. Therefore, from now on, if you want to advertise as a political person, you have to say same thing to everybody because, that’s what democracy is.\n\nDöpfner: You said at the very beginning that you think net-net, of course, the World Wide Web and the whole digitization of our society has more positive elements than negative ones, but among the negative ones, which is your biggest worry?\n\nBerners-Lee: I used to say blocking and spying and Web censorship. The censorship, of course, is bad, but if censorship is bad, spying is worse. The really bad regimes, they let you go to the sites they don’t like, and then they monitor you, and they find your family, throw you in jail.\n\nDöpfner: Is there a government that is particularly worrying you?\n\nBerners-Lee: Turkey is a classic example of blocking. They blocked Twitter, and they put it back on. I hope they realize that that’s no way to run a country and that it will just become so inefficient, and I imagine there will be protests.\n\nDöpfner: Yeah, absolutely. And now they block Wikipedia.\n\nBerners-Lee: That will be a battle. Some of the Middle Eastern countries have been pretty reprehensible in the past when it comes to spying on people and using that to round up their critics.\n\nDöpfner: How about companies? Governments and their possibilities to manipulate and abuse data is one thing. The other thing is big international conglomerates that could also end up in the hands of certain governments. How do you see that? The first ring is governments, but the second ring is big companies, or are you less afraid by the role that big corporations are playing?\n\nBerners-Lee: I’m just as afraid really. It’s funny. Growing up in the UK, and UK people have a fond trust of their government, but they’re deeply suspicious of companies. And in America...\n\nDöpfner: …it’s the other way around.\n\nBerners-Lee: Yes, they have a faith in corporations but are taught as children to distrust their government. I think the British contingent will end up overtrusting their government, and the Americans will end up overtrusting their corporations.\n\nOf course, sometimes, in China, it’s hard to tell the difference. Sometimes, in America, it’s hard to tell the difference, too.\n\nDöpfner: But you are deeply rooted in the free market economy, aren’t you?\n\nBerners-Lee: In the free market, yeah.\n\nDöpfner: And free market needs competition.\n\nBerners-Lee: It does need competition.\n\nDöpfner: And diversity.\n\nBerners-Lee: It does need to have a separate market for connectivity and for content.\n\nDöpfner: To which degree will virtual reality, augmented reality change the Web and change the world? Is it hype, or is it a game changer?\n\nBerners-Lee: In 1994 when we had the first Web conference at CERN, one of the sessions was on virtual reality, and it was on designing Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML). So we thought that, within a few years, by the end of the ’90s, all the websites would be 3D. They would just be so much more interesting.\n\nSo I think it’s going to be really hard to make predictions. I think augmented reality is to an extent already there because when we use a map, then you have the ability to see more logical details about the things you’re looking at. Augmented reality will increase. Virtual reality, I think it would be great fun to try a world in which you and I can have this conversation.\n\nDöpfner: Without being in the same room.\n\nBerners-Lee: But where really the pixels or the stereoscopic system is so good, I really have to look at you very carefully to realize that you’re not here.\n\nDöpfner: That you’re not here, yeah, and you can even have a certain simulation of the senses.\n\nDo you share the vision that, in a couple of years, maybe the normal conversation that people are having is not happening on the phone, it’s not happening through email? It is really happening like a virtual reality conversation where you basically meet without being in the same room?\n\nBerners-Lee: I think a lot of people do that now. A lot of people meet on Skype and Facetime.\n\nDöpfner: Yeah, but that’s a two-dimensional experience. You don’t really have the feeling, as you just described it, that you’re really sitting in the same room.\n\nBerners-Lee: I don’t know. We’ll see.\n\nDöpfner: So looking, let’s say, 50 years ahead, what will the world look like, particularly with regard to communication and the effects that digitization has on it?\n\nBerners-Lee: Well, we’re at an interesting time now. The World Wide Web has been increasing exponentially, but now it’s got to 50 percent of the world. It’s pretty amazing that this proportion of the world is using it at all.\n\nWe set up the Web Foundation a decade ago when the concern was that only 10% of t the world was using the Web. The challenge was the other 90%. Now as we have got to 50% and people are getting online faster than ever, and soon the issues will change as they online world becomes the majority. Then different things become a concern when most of sub-Saharan Africa villages are online, when 3G, 4G, 5G cell towers will be ubiquitous.\n\nPeople who can’t get online at that point will need a different sort of technology. There will be low earth orbit satellites, for example or something or balloons, but there has to be a new push to get them online. That push may have to be subsidized because those people will be in remote areas. But the problem will be that the discrimination against them will be much more intense because it’ll be so efficient for any company to assume their customers are online..\n\nDöpfner: So a widening gap? Isn’t digitization closing the gap?\n\nBerners-Lee: A widening gap between those who have and those who don’t have because there will be a mounting assumption from anybody providing a service that you’re online. For a government or a company, just it will be economic nonsense to go to the trouble of catering to the people who haven’t bothered to connect.\n\nDöpfner: But so far, until today, you could find very good facts and figures to prove the opposite theory, that digitization has closed the gap or that digitization has redistributed money from the wealthy to the not wealthy. Basically, if you look to the developing countries, they are more and more benefiting from digitization with regard to the accessibility of knowledge and the distribution of wealth.\n\nBerners-Lee: It’s absolutely true, yes. No, I was talking about the last 10 percent. So as they benefit, yes, then the benefit to humanity is lots and lots of people can get healthcare information. It’s huge, clearly, although when you look at that sort of thing, you might see the benefit to the people who were poor are now less poor and are connecting throughout the developing countries.\n\nYou might also look at where some of that money has all gone, and you might be very concerned about the economic distribution in the developed countries, which is worse than ever before.\n\nDöpfner: The historian Yuval Harari just wrote a book called Homo Deus, where he basically says that mankind has had to deal for the last centuries with three main challenges. That was war, famine, and plagues. He said that these things are basically resolved. More people are dying from too much sugar than from not enough food. Never in history were less people dying from war and violence. most of the plagues are resolved because modern medicine has basically killed pests, pocks and almost everything.\n\nthen he says the new project of mankind will be longevity or immortality. Is that something that you see as a big trend for the next decades if we’re speaking of a 50-year time horizon that people could live for 120, 150 years, or that they may even be able to live forever, like Ray Kurzweil has described it with his singularity theory? Is that something that you take seriously?\n\nBerners-Lee: Yes, I do.\n\nDöpfner: You do. That’s good news. Tell me why.\n\nBerners-Lee: I take it seriously because, when I talk to people who build robots, they complain that it’s so hard to make them smart. They can’t imagine the singularity coming when they’ll be smarter than them.\n\nHowever, but when you step back and you look at the steps, the huge tasks that the AI community has checked off of machine understanding, machine translation, motion, all this planning, finding your way across a city, playing chess, that sort of thing, playing Jeopardy, diagnosing medical things, I feel that there’s certainly reason to imagine that the machines that we build will at some point become smarter than us.\n\nWe have to decide what our priorities are and whether our priority is in fact to promote exclusively the human race or whether we’ll be promoting other machine intelligence.\n\nDöpfner: So do you think, like Elon Musk, that there is a likelihood that artificial intelligence is going to be smarter than human intelligence and is going to win the battle?\n\nBerners-Lee: I find it very hard to argue against that, yes.\n\nDöpfner: So a last question, in that context: do you think that man and machine, robots and human beings are going to merge? Or is it more purely medical progress that makes it easier for people to live longer?\n\nBerners-Lee: I think machine intelligence will help. It’ll be machines which aids, but a great intelligence I think will be designed by people, but it will be not a person in itself.\n\nDöpfner: Timothy Berners-Lee is a living legend as an inventor of something that really has changed the world. Has that ever put pressure on you? Did it cause certain crises about your next projects or scientific research or invention?\n\nBerners-Lee: Well, my day job for many years has been as the Director of W3C, and that has been a great community of people. It’s been very collaborative. It’s involved wonderful sparkling minds from across the industry getting together to build the Web from being the World Wide Web of static webpages as documents to webpages as programs and so webpages as a computer.\n\nKonrad Zuse invented the computer. In a way, what we’re doing is we’re making that invention but within the website. A webpage is now something you can program.\n\nSo that’s been a huge change, been very exciting. Most of the time, in day-to-day life, people at W3C just know me as this guy who has got certain sometimes annoying personal feelings about how the architecture of the Web should be. People in the Lab, (MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, CSAIL), know me as another guy that builds things.\n\nDöpfner: What’s the most important project that you’re working on at the moment? Is there anything that is particularly on top of your mind?\n\nBerners-Lee: One of the things which we’re doing in the lab at MIT is we’re reacting to the world in which people don’t control their data by designing a technical solution that’s called Solid. The idea is that we imagine a world in which you completely control your data.\n\nSo when you start an app, it says, „Where do you want to store it?“ I’ll store this on this computer, and I’ll store this in my Cloud. But whether it’s your computer or your Cloud, it completely reports to you, and you determine who gets to use it for what.\n\nSo we’re imagining that world. It’s not just about privacy, but it’s much more about enabling you because we believe that the data that you have about yourself is actually more valuable to you than to anybody.\n\nDöpfner: What are the books that you’re reading? You’re reading scientific literature, history books, or also novels, and if so, which?\n\nBerners-Lee: I read all kinds of stuff, but I suppose I rarely read a book from beginning to end. I get pointed at so many things. I follow a few news sources on Twitter of reliable news. Random people introduce me to things. I’m in lots of different discussions on different media.\n\nDöpfner: Is there any book that changed your life?\n\nBerners-Lee: It would be tempting to talk about Enquire Within Upon Everything, but really, that was just the title of the book. The book didn’t change my life. that was a Victorian book in which it was a sort of a Wikipedia. It was on my parents’ shelves, and I used it as a programmer as a title for the program I made in 1980 way back then in the days of green screens, so Enquire Within Upon Everything.\n\nMathias Döpfner: Do you believe in God?\n\nTim Berners-Lee: Not in the sense of most people. I’m atheist and Unitarian Universalist.\n\nMathias Döpfner: Thank you very much.","author":"Mathias Döpfner, Die Welt","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T16:18:42.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/590f47c852b5d820008b4f0a-1190-625/the-inventor-of-the-web-tim-berners-lee-on-the-future-of-the-internet-fake-news-and-why-net-neutrality-is-so-important.jpg","class":"Sports","digest":"rq2ElVlw+l31m+mw8Mjumg==\n"}

The veteran auto executive sat down with Business Insider at the 2017 New York International Auto Show. Our conversation touched on various topics including the state of the US auto market, the company's new South Carolina factory, and Volvo's plan for autonomous driving.\n\nOn the state of the US auto market:\n\nIn 2016, automakers sold a record 17.6 million cars in the US. But, thus far in 2017, the auto market has struggled to keep up with last year's torrid pace. While Kerssemakers sees increasing difficulty in trying live up to 2016, he still believes in the strength of the US market.\n\n\"The pressure is definitely increasing and the level of incentive spending is up,\" Kerssemakers said. \"But we're still talking about (selling) 16 million to 17 million cars. It's still pretty high, even if we're a bit disappointed that it's down compared to last year.\"\n\nFurther, he believes Volvo's relatively small market share, when compared to Detroit's Big Three, dulls much of the effects of most sales fluctuations.\n\n\"To be honest, as a brand with 0.5% to 0.6% market share, I'm not looking everyday at the development of the overall US market in the same way as brands with greater sales volume like the Big 3,\" the Volvo boss said. \"I think it can fluctuate quite a lot before a brand like Volvo is affected.\"\n\nOn being a US and a global manufacturer:\n\nOne of the tenets of the Trump Administration has been the bolstering of US manufacturing. For Volvo, the centerpiece of the US production plan is a new $500 million factory in South Carolina that is expected to enter service in the third quarter of 2018.\n\n\"We decided two years ago to (manufacture) in the United States because we wanted to give a clear signal to our retailers, who have been our loyal partners, and to our customers that we are here to stay,\" the affable Dutchman said. \"In 2007 and 2008, articles popped up of people saying that Volvo is going to leave the US market and that's absolutely not true. So the best proof of that is to put a factory on American soil, which we did.\"\n\nNow with plants in Europe, China, and US, Volvo has domestic production facilities in the three most important markets in the world. According to Kerssemakers, local manufacturing brings Volvo closer to its consumers and shields the company from fluctuations in the global currencies.\n\nThe new factory, expected to have the ability churn out 100,000 cars a year, will produce the company's next generation S60 sedan for domestic consumption and export.\n\nOn Chinese-made Volvos:\n\nIn 2015, Volvo made waves by importing its long-wheel-base S60L Inscription sedan — becoming the first major brand to sell Chinese-made cars in the US. The S60L was originally developed for China's chauffeur's culture, but the car made its debut in the US as the luxury-spec Inscription model.\n\n\"We decided to import it two years ago and now it's 70% of our S60 sales in the US because, like the Chinese, Americans like space as well,\" he told us. \"It's a win-win because the retailers love it and so the customers.\"\n\nAccording to Kerssemakers, the success of the S60L is representative of the advantages of having a global manufacturing footprint that allows the company better flexibility to tailor its product offerings based on regional needs.\n\nWhile it's become a success, there are still lingering concerns among the public and the media about China's ability to produce cars that are on par with their Swedish counterparts.\n\n\"To be honest, there's no (difference in quality) at all,\" the Volvo chief executive said. \"It's absolutely a none issue. It's purely between the ears.\"\n\nIn fact, when the first S60s came in from China, the company's dealers went through the car with a fine tooth comb looking for quality issues and didn't find anything, Kerssemakers said.\n\n\"We have a global manufacturing process that includes Swedish engineers who go to China, train everybody there and see that everything is running according to Volvo standards,\" Kerssemakers told us. \"Irrespective of where it's produced, it's the same quality.\"\n\nOn the future of Volvo tech:\n\nBy committing to small-displacement, four-cylinder turbo engines and electrification in 2008, Volvo made the bold decision to push the brand towards the direction of advanced technology and environmental friendliness rather than traditional luxury.\n\nNow it's working towards the next frontier, autonomous driving.\n\nOne of Volvo's partners in the development of next generation autonomous technology is Uber. However, the controversial tech firm's efforts have been beset by development issues including the crash of an autonomous XC90 test car in Arizona.\n\nHowever, Volvo is not wavering in its support of Uber's autonomous driving program.\n\n\"Accidents do happen, but we believe in the partnership with Uber and we are fully confident that it will continue to be fruitful,\" Kerssemakers said.\n\nHowever, the Volvo CEO cautioned that the public and the auto industry should be cautious in the pace of developing autonomous tech development.\n\n\"There's a lot of talk about autonomous drive, but there are a lot of systems out there that are not autonomous drive. They are pilot assist systems,\" he said. \"We should be very careful that we don't start to believe we are there already.\"\n\nIn fact, Kerssemakers told us that true level 4 or level 5 autonomy won't be ready until well into the next decade.\n\n\"Every company, every brand is driving millions of test miles with autonomous cars. So we are still in a test phase,\" he said.\n\nBut, even with Volvo's new tilt towards high tech, the brand stands for one thing above all else and that's safety. As a result, for Kerssemakers, success in the quest for autonomous driving doesn't necessarily mean being first in the marketplace, rather it's about being the safest and most reliable.\n\n\"This is not a sprint we want to win and be the first, it's not about that. We want to be leading, but leading means high tech that's reliable and safe,\" he said. \"For Volvo, it's a marathon, not a sprint.\"","author":"Benjamin Zhang","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T14:07:00.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/590769562f6ae4431f8b4c17-1190-625/volvo-is-sticking-with-uber-to-win-the-autonomous-driving-marathon.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"p2D41wnyXpXofSCK4VxVYQ==\n"}

His lawyer said in a statement in March that Kushner was fully complying with ethics rules, removing himself from active participation in his prior businesses and divesting assets.\n\nA Kushner Companies spokeswoman declined to comment in a New York Times article about the Beijing event published on Saturday.\n\nThe Times story said Meyer did not respond when asked if she was concerned about possible conflicts of interest facing her brother. Journalists from the Times and Washington Post were removed from Saturday's Beijing event, the newspapers reported.\n\nPOPULAR WITH WEALTHY CHINESE\n\nOne potential investor, Sophie Xing, said a \"very important\" factor in her decision to attend Sunday's event was the fact that the project was a Kushner Companies investment and that Trump's son-in-law's sister would be showing up in Shanghai.\n\n\"Actually I really don't know how close they are but I felt that this was a pretty good project,\" she said.\n\nIn a promotional text message seen by Reuters, Qiaowai made note of Meyer's relationship to Trump and called her the event's \"heavyweight honored guest\".\n\nQiaowei representatives at the event declined to answer questions from journalists, and calls to its listed phone number went unanswered.\n\nQiaowei is also known as QWOS. Its promotional materials for the project, which it also calls Kushner1, advertise the prospect of putting money in under the federal EB-5 program.\n\nThe program is popular among wealthy Chinese looking to shift assets abroad or move overseas, but it has come under fire in the United States.\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers have called for changing or abolishing the EB-5 program, but the scheme was recently renewed by Congress until Sept. 30.\n\nPotential investor Xing said a Kushner representative who spoke on Sunday stressed that EB-5 rules could change after September to raise the minimum required investment.\n\nAnother person who attended Sunday's event, Liu Guoqi, was mindful of the potential rule change. Liu said he had been to previous pitches for EB-5 investments but had concerns about the risks.\n\n\"The whole thing may change later this year so we feel that there isn't much time left,\" he said.\n\nIn the United States, the EB-5 program has also sparked concerns about possible scams. Some immigrants have been burned by misrepresentations made about the program by promoters, both inside and outside the United States. Many have lost not only their money but their chance at winning U.S. citizenship.\n\nTrump has vowed to clamp down on illegal immigration.\n\nIn addition to Beijing and Shanghai, the road show for One Journal Square was scheduled to hit the Chinese cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Wuhan, according to Qiaowai's marketing materials online.\n\nIt calls the Kushner family a \"famous real estate clan\", and touts EB-5 immigration as \"peace of mind\".\n\nQiaowai's Chinese-language marketing material describes the project as \"supported by the government, created by a star developer\", and says the project is its 87th EB-5 program.\n\n(Editing by Tony Munroe and Alex Richardson)","author":"John Ruwitch, Reuters","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T13:08:00.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/590f1c3e52b5d820008b4efe-1190-625/jared-kushners-family-is-trying-to-raise-150-million-from-chinese-investors-in-exchange-for-us-visas.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"yGYqltkXpTgVFDBYizvoKA==\n"}

It's crazy,\" McKinnon said, mimicking Brzezinski's tone and expressive body language.\n\n\"Mika's over it,\" Moffat said.\n\n\"I am. I'm ... I'm up it, I'm over it, I'm past it, I'm in the driveway, the car is running,\" McKinnon replied. \"This party — your party, the Republican party — is completely morally bankrupt. I'm disappointed,\" McKinnon continued, speaking to Moffat's Scarborough.\n\nScarborough is a Republican while Brzezinski is a Democrat.\n\n\"Oh, Mika, that's enough, OK,\" Moffat said, before turning to McKinnon. \"You're being snickety because you know it pushes my buttons.\"\n\nMcKinnon then turned to Moffat. \"Does it ... push your buttons?\" she asked, while moving closer to him.\n\nThe two actors started flirting on set while McKinnon ran a hand through Moffat's hair. The display was an apparent reference to the news that Scarborough and Brzezinski became engaged and the hosts' subsequent attempt to avoid talking about their personal lives on the show.\n\nThe skit also featured other actors playing the show's regular columnists, all of whom acted surprised and disgusted by McKinnon's and Moffat's on-air displays of affection.\n\nThe hosts also blasted an AHCA amendment that would allow states to waive Obamacare's pre-existing conditions requirement if they meet certain criteria.\n\n\"A C-section is a pre-existing condition,\" McKinnon said. \"And you know what's not a pre-existing condition? Erectile dysfunction,\" she continued.\n\n\"Well, hold on,\" Moffat said, appearing to get irritated. \"Now, here we go, all right, Mika, you're being dramatic,\" he added.\n\nThe two hosts continued engaging in suggestive behavior throughout the skit — Moffat's Scarborough called McKinnon's Brzezinski \"Mika mouse\" and repeatedly said, \"You're being naughty\" — and in front of the show's panelists, who all looked confused and uncomfortable.\n\n\"Willie Geist, what are you seeing here?\" Moffat asked, seeking panelists' thoughts on the AHCA.\n\n\"Uh, what am I seeing here? I have no idea, I have so many unanswered questions,\" said Willie Geist, who was played by SNL regular Mikey Day.\n\nThe skit also featured Alec Baldwin, who played Trump's media spokesman, John Miller.

There was beer, the disaster that was Obamacare has finally been repealed,\" he continued, before Moffat interrupted him to say that the bill had not yet become law.\n\n\"The bill goes through the Senate.

The government has struggled to cope with immigration and integration.\n\nBy 5 p.m. Paris time (11 a.m. ET), 65.3% of registered voters had cast their ballots. That turnout is down from the last election day in 2012, when almost 72% of registered voters had cast ballots by 5 p.m..\n\nA high abstention rate is likely to hit Macron harder than Le Pen, analysts have said.\n\nIn the election's first round two weeks ago, voters rejected representatives of all the traditional mainstream political parties in France, with Macron and Le Pen topping a field of 11 candidates by taking 24% and 21% of the vote, respectively.\n\nBy noon, voter turnout reaches 28,23% according to France's Ministry of Interior. #presidentielles2017 pic.twitter.com/ZbWw9cMZiC — Kara Fox (@karadaniellefox) May 7, 2017\n\nAround 14.5 gigabytes of emails, personal and business documents were posted to the text-sharing site Pastebin just hours before the campaign period came to a close Friday night.\n\nMacron's party said the hackers had mixed fake documents with authentic ones \"to create confusion and misinformation.\" It is not clear who was behind the attack.\n\nLe Pen has spent the past few weeks battling to extend her appeal beyond her traditional base of supporters, while Macron has been attempting to convince voters that he is not part of the political elite they rejected in the first round.\n\nMacron, 39, has campaigned on a pro-Europe, pro-integration platform.

Some 12,000 extra police and soldiers are on duty in the capital for election day to secure polling stations and the candidates' headquarters, Paris police said.\n\nThere appeared to be a security alert at the Louvre in Paris in the early afternoon, as police cleared journalists from an area outside the art museum's famous glass pyramid.\n\nMacron's camp has booked the courtyard there to hold a rally after the polls close, and hundreds of journalists are accredited to cover the event.\n\nParis police tried to play down the sweep, saying they were scouring the scene to check there was \"nothing dangerous,\" in what they said was a \"precaution.\"\n\nSoldiers patrol the Louvre in Paris, where Emmanuel Macron will hold a rally after polls close Sunday.\n\nCampaign gets dirty\n\nThe campaign period ahead of the final round has had its dirty moments.\n\nBoth candidates traded insults in a bad-tempered, head-to-head debate on French television on Wednesday. Macron called Le Pen a liar who sowed division and hatred, while she accused him of being soft on terrorism and said he would preside over a nation enfeebled by its powerful neighbor, Germany.\n\nLe Pen and Macron faced each other in a bad-tempered TV debate.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the debate, the Paris prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation after Macron filed a complaint against Le Pen following her claim during the debate that he may have an offshore account in the Bahamas.\n\nMacron, a former investment banker, who also served as economy minister under Hollande, has struggled to connect with voters in the rural and de-industrialized areas of the country.\n\nHe was upstaged in his own hometown of Amiens, when Le Pen made a surprise visit to a Whirlpool factory at threat of closure to rally support while Macron met with union representatives in the same city.\n\nLe Pen's camp heavily criticized Macron for his celebrations after the first round of voting, labeling him as arrogant.\n\nWill voters abstain?\n\nIn the final polls published before campaigning ended on Friday, Macron appeared to have retained a healthy lead. But the unknown quantity is turnout: A campaign launched last week urged voters to stay at home, leave their ballot envelope empty or submit a blank piece of paper instead of a ballot slip. It is unclear if the steady voter turnout in the morning will continue through the day.\n\nBoycott 2017 badges at a May Day rally in Paris. The Boycott 2017 campaign calls on voters to back \"neither Le Pen, nor Macron.\n\nWhile the first-round turnout was relatively healthy, official government figures show more people abstained in the April 23 vote than the number who voted for any single candidate -- including Macron and National Front's Le Pen.\n\nThe big challenge for Le Pen has been to broaden her appeal. At the end of last month, she announced that she had temporarily stepped down from her position as leader of the National Front. Some saw that as an attempt to distance herself from the party, regarded as toxic by many in France.\n\nBut her position in the polls has barely moved since the first round. If Le Pen is elected, it would be one of the biggest shocks in postwar French political history.","author":"James Masters, Kara Fox and Bryony Jones, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T16:45:04.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170507110631-french-voting-super-tease.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"W0d2/WoG6FqWubzulfb+tg==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"590f70c6522ffcfb9a9ac577"},"description":"Riding a global wave of populism, France's far-right National Front leader, Marine Le Pen, is convinced her time has finally come.","title":"Who is Marine Le Pen?","url":"http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/europe/marine-le-pen-profile/index.html","text":"Paris (CNN) For most of her life, Marine Le Pen has lived in the shadow of her father. Jean-Marie Le Pen founded the far-right National Front in 1972, a party that she would come to lead some 40 years later. Changing its racist and anti-Semitic image has taken time, determination and a bitter family feud.\n\nAs one of two candidates left standing in the French presidential race, Le Pen has her chance to prove that the Front National's time has finally come. French voters go to the polls Sunday in a final round of votes to choose between Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron.\n\nIn the shadow of Jean-Marie\n\nAt 48, Marine Le Pen is a twice-divorced mother of three. She has regularly pleaded for the privacy of her children, seeking to protect them from the spotlight.\n\nHer relationship with her father, however, has been the subject of much media scrutiny.\n\nNational Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen stands in front of his daughter Marine Le Pen, president of the party.\n\nA bomb explosion at the family's Paris apartment when she was 8 made her aware of her father's notoriety. And after her parents' divorce, she began spending more and more time at her father's office.\n\nHer talent for public speaking led her to study law, and in 1998, to a role as a legal adviser to her father's party. As she rose through the National Front's ranks -- becoming vice-president, a member of the European Parliament and then a member of Parliament in France -- she she also tried to soften the party's image.\n\nThis led to tension with her outspoken father. And it wasn't until she took over as president in 2011 that she was able to rebrand the party as she wished.\n\nIn 2013 though, Jean-Marie Le Pen repeated his claim that the Nazi gas chambers had been but a detail of history , leading to a very public falling out and to his expulsion from the party he'd created.\n\nWhat does she stand for?\n\nLe Pen shares her father's core anti-immigration beliefs, which remain central to her platform. She wants to slash legal immigration from 200,000 to 10,000 \"entries\" per year in France, and also wants to see immigrants' access to public services limited.\n\nLe Pen stands on stage with other far-right European politicians at an event hosted by the Europe of Nations and Freedom political group.\n\nLe Pen believes that only her particular brand of political isolationism and economic nationalism can protect France from the twin evils of \"Anglo-Saxon multiculturalism\" and politically correct liberalism.\n\nEconomically, she's a conservative who believes in protecting France's workers and its large social safety net. She presents herself as the true champion of blue-collar France and has managed to win over working-class voters, who are worried by calls from both the left and right for the liberalization of France's highly regulated labor market.\n\nLe Pen is in favor of a return to the French franc currency and has promised a referendum on remaining in Europe -- à la Brexit -- if she is elected. She is also in favor of France's withdrawal from NATO.\n\nOn a number of issues, Le Pen's positions mirror closely those of Donald Trump -- and she believes that his victory in the American election will clear the way for her own in France.\n\nLe Pen was spotted at Trump Tower in Manhattan prior to Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nInternationally, Le Pen wants closer ties with Russia and she's been criticized for taking a loan from a Russian bank. In an interview with CNN last year , Le Pen said she was left with no choice after being turned down by French banks.\n\nCan she really win?\n\nNational opinion polls indicated that Le Pen was leading the candidates ahead of the spring vote, with only the Republican, Francois Fillon , anywhere near her.\n\nBut a growing controversy over the alleged payment of parliamentary funds to his wife for a no-show job threatened Fillon's campaign. And a fragmented political landscape made it hard for any of the other candidates to stand up to her.\n\nSupport for Macron grew and remained strong, however, and the centrist pushed Le Pen into second place in the first round.\n\nAfter the first round of votes in April, Macron came out on top with 24.01% of the vote among 11 candidates, with Le Pen not far behind with 21.3%.\n\nA man holds a Marine Le Pen placard at a conference of European populist, right-wing parties in Koblenz, Germany.\n\nJust as in 2002, the last time her party made it to the second round, she will face the \"republican front\" that will gather behind Macron in a determined effort to keep the National Front away from power . Until now, this strategy has proven effective, both nationally and regionally.\n\nThe party has, over the last few years, achieved high opinion poll ratings, but still struggled to win power. It controls only a dozen towns in France and at a regional level has been kept away from the top positions. But Le Pen believes that after the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and Trump's victory in the United States, the wave of populism might be strong enough to break through the barriers of the past and to take her all the way to the Élysée.","author":"Melissa Bell, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T16:00:13.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170131105251-01-marine-le-pen-file-0131-super-tease.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"NHYbKhJO8tDMgjmq0OroVw==\n"}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN) Gamblers are likely betting on Democrats to do quite well in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nHistorically, the party of the president gets a shellacking, as President Obama called it in 2010, in the first midterm that they face. There have been only two cases when the president's party gained in both houses of Congress since the Civil War: in 1934 and in 2002.\n\nBesides the normal historical cycle of backlash against the White House, Democrats this time around are whetting their lips because House Republicans have just voted for a health care bill that rescinds benefits for millions of hard-working Americans.\n\nThis could prove to be a policy victory that ends in political defeat. Between the midterms' track record and the polarizing health care legislation, this week's events would seem to be a recipe for political disaster for the GOP.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, see a silver lining in the House vote. They are hoping that TrumpCare will become the Republican ObamaCare, producing the same flip of control of the House that Democrats suffered in 2010.\n\nAccording to David Wasserman of the Cook Report, one of the shrewdest political observers around, the vote \"guarantees Democrats will have at least one major on-the-record vote to exploit in the next elections.\"\n\nAnd according to one Republican political strategist who deeply dislikes the president, \"What we've done here is political malpractice. Democrats will run ads with weeping parents who can't cover their premiums and Little Johnny dying ...\"\n\nA sweep for Democrats?\n\nBut is a Democratic sweep in 2018 really so certain? Is it so obvious that Republicans are on the verge of total electoral disaster?\n\nThe answers are not as clear as they might seem. Despite the House vote, President Trump and the GOP are looking at some pretty good economic numbers today.\n\nWith the economy having reached full employment, the best conditions in more than 10 years, many voters will be in good spirits about the status quo. Notwithstanding all the talk about the impact of the health care legislation, the bottom line to Americans' pocketbooks will matter a great deal come the midterm campaigns.\n\nIf conditions don't change significantly, Republicans will benefit. President Trump and the GOP, whether they deserve it or not, will be able to claim credit for the recovery. (Presidents usually get the blame or credit for economic conditions, even if they don't have a big impact on them.)\n\nRepublicans will say that indeed he is making America great again. Trump's supporters will feel that he delivered. Many Republicans who never loved Trump will nevertheless be pleased with the state of economic affairs.\n\nThere has been much discussion about the current version of the House bill and its \"losers\" who will make their angry voices known. But there are winners as well who will support what the GOP has done: wealthy Americans whose taxes will be lower, upper-middle-class Americans without pre-existing conditions, younger middle-class people who don't want insurance or want more meager insurance, and large employers who don't face the the mandate to offer coverage as they did under Obamacare.\n\nTo be sure, Republican candidates will face the ire of hospitals, Medicaid recipients and elderly Americans who are furious about the impact of the reform, if it passes. But this is not a bill that only takes things away from voters. Indeed, the bill redistributes benefits to some very powerful sectors of the country.\n\nBenefits of winning\n\nThe benefits of winning in politics are important. If a health care measure gets through the Senate, Republican voters will be energized about a watershed victory. On the campaign trail, Republicans will have something to brag about when discussing what they have achieved in the Trump Era.\n\nIt is also very possible that passing health care would open to doors to a major supply-side tax cut that would bolster the confidence of core Republican constituencies who have money to spend on campaigns.\n\nDemocrats who are counting on a backlash to Trumpcare should also be careful not to forget that we live in a political world where public perceptions of policy and government are not simply the product of rational calculations by voters.\n\nThey learned this in the 2016 election but seem to have forgot the lesson. Partisan forces, ranging from the president to biased media outlets, can have a profound impact on how voters interpret what is happening in the political world.\n\nMaster of spin\n\nRepublicans have proven to be enormously successful at shaping the narrative about government decisions and policy. President Trump is a master of spin.\n\nAs the impact of a health care bill becomes clear, statistics won't be the only thing that matters. Democrats will have to counteract the powerful public relations campaign that President Trump and Republicans will certainly mount to convince voters that all the positives in health care are a product of their efforts and all the problems are still legacies of President Obama's broken policies.\n\nThe midterms are more than 18 months away, and a lot can happen to shape how they will play out.\n\nYet Republicans can still count on gerrymandered districts to protect incumbents in a large part of the red map. While courts have forced some states to redraw districts put into place after 2010, many of them remain in place for 2018.\n\nWith the largest GOP majority in the House since 1928, it won't be easy for Democrats to retake control of Congress. Democrats will have some heavy lifting to do, even with history on their side.\n\nMath favors Republicans\n\nIn the Senate, as CNN's Chris Cilizza recently wrote, Democrats must defend 25 seats. The Republicans are defending only eight. Ten of the states Democrats need to protect are in states that Donald Trump won. In North Dakota, Missouri, Montana, West Virginia and Indiana, he won by whopping margins.\n\nNor is it likely that the House bill will be the final legislation. Senate Republicans are already toying with a number of changes, such as boosting tax credits for low-income Americans or delaying the end of the Medicaid expansion that would make the bill more politically palatable in the short-term.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIf they do, and Freedom Caucus Republicans in the House decide that they need to deliver some kind of legislation, even if flawed, this could fundamentally change the dynamics of how the bill is perceived in the near future.\n\nThe reality is that Democrats should not be too giddy about the recent vote and their prospects come 2018. It will be a long slog to retake control of Congress and even to put a significant dent in the size of the Republican majorities. And Republicans can make a credible case that they will retain control of Congress and carry out more of their conservative agenda in the years ahead.","author":"Julian Zelizer","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T16:36:26.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170504185310-02-trump-rose-garden-healthcare-0504-super-tease.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"dEkTx1r0k1syCRbN3b2K/g==\n"}

John Kasich slammed the GOP health care bill on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday morning, calling it \"inadequate\" and saying his party was \"trying to fulfill a campaign promise\" in pushing it through.\n\nThe former presidential candidate said Medicaid covers 700,000 people in his state, a third of whom have mental illness or drug addictions and a quarter of whom have chronic diseases -- people who Kasich said would be hurt by the proposed changes in the bill.\n\nKasich cited how the bill would limit Medicaid expansion by 2020, which he said would create problems because of the way people cycle off of Medicaid coverage -- and never to get back on.\n\n\"I don't have a problem trying to move the Medicaid expansion, which gives an enhanced match from the federal government, to a more traditional match, but you can't do that overnight,\" he said.\n\nKasich also said the bill would require certain people to buy insurance policies on the state exchanges, which come with pricey premiums and deductibles, rendering coverage unaffordable for many of those coming off Medicaid. The tax credit provided under the GOP would not be enough to offset the higher costs, Kasich said.\n\n\"How do we think that the mentally ill have the ability to pay the deductible on an insurance policy that they have that they can buy for $3,000?\" Kasich said, adding that people whose coverage he says would suffer under the bill will be \"living in the emergency rooms again.\"\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office's original score of the bill in March stated the plan would cut $880 billion from Medicaid over 10 years.\n\nHowever, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price refuted the CBO's estimate of cuts earlier in the show and, when pressed repeatedly by CNN's Jake Tapper on whether the projected cuts would translate into millions of people losing coverage, said \"absolutely not.\"\n\n\"Remember that there are no cuts to the Medicaid program; there's increases in spending, but what we're doing is apportioning it in a way that allows the states more flexibility to cover their Medicaid and care for their Medicaid population,\" Price said.\n\n\"We believe strongly that the Medicaid population will be cared for in a better way under our program because it will be more responsive to them,\" Price said.\n\nHowever, the cuts would put pressure on the states to make up for federal funding shortfalls under the GOP bill, which has a number of governors wary that the lack of funds could lead to them to limit benefits, reduce eligibility or cut provider payments.\n\n\"I think the fundamental issue here are the resources,\" Kasich said. \"I don't want to give you exactly the numbers, but it's about half the resources in this bill that were in Obamacare. Now, I can tell you we can do with less resources, but you can't do it overnight and you can't give people a $3,000 or 4,000 health insurance policy. You know where they're going to be? They're going to be living in the emergency rooms again.\"\n\n\"This was not great, and it's going to go to the Senate, and I hope and pray that they write a bigger bill,\" Kasich said.\n\nOn ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine addressed concerns about the bill, saying she hoped it would eventually expand coverage for those still not covered under Obamacare.\n\n\"The Senate is starting from scratch,\" Collins said. \"We're going to draft our own bill. And I'm convinced that we're going to take the time to do it right.\"\n\nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus told Fox News' Chris Wallace on Sunday that he expected the Senate to make any improvements to the House bill and bring it to a House and Senate conference committee.\n\nAsked whether he thought the bill, which was narrowly passed by the House, would become a drag on Republicans in 2018 as Democrats suggest, Priebus said sometimes in life, \"you have to do what's right, not what's politically expedient.\"\n\n\"We believe this is going to be a better product,\" he said. \"And by the time the people see that premiums are lower, it's a better service, there are more options and more choices, they're going to reward the Republicans that stood up and said, 'We are not going to see the Obamacare system, which is failing and collapsing, continue any longer. We're going to do something better, and we're going to do our job as legislators to get this thing done.' I think that the Republican Party will be rewarded.\"","author":"Sophie Tatum","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T17:40:09.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161219184839-john-kasich-super-tease.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"oYT14RYsJQ/2m79+4Ahpkw==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"590f70cb522ffcfb9a9ac58b"},"description":"LCD Soundsystem were the night’s musical guests","title":"'Saturday Night Live' Recap: Chris Pine Gets Musical","url":"http://ew.com/recap/saturday-night-live-season-42-episode-19/","text":"In the second fully live broadcast in SNL history, Chris Pine made his debut as host in what was perhaps one of the most musical episodes in recent memory — no fewer than seven sketches involved music in some way. The first was in Pine’s opening monologue, where he assured us of his identity: He’s not Chris Pratt, Evans, or Hemsworth. He’s Chris Pine. In true beating-a-dead-horse fashion, Pine even trotted out a total of two large poster boards showing the aforementioned other Chrises before the monologue peaked (or fizzled?) with a musical number set to Billy Joel and a shiny, golden banner bearing Pine’s name.\n\nBut before that was the cold open, which targeted an easy bullseye: MSNBC’s Morning Joe hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, here skewered by Kate McKinnon and Alex Moffat, respectively. After the morning news hosts outed their relationship and announced their engagement last week, SNL imagined the couple’s unpredictable on-air chemistry causing some discomfort among their panel of commentators, who all deliver priceless reaction shots.\n\nAlec Baldwin still managed to steal the show, though, even by phoning it in — here, his Trump calls in to Morning Joe, posing as a White House rep. He makes sure to drop some highly off-color Cinco de Mayo (“sink of mayonnaise”) jokes before gloating about getting his healthcare bill passed in the House. When Moffat-as-Scarborough points out that the bill still needs to win over the Senate, Trump hurriedly hangs up in mock panic.\n\nBest Sketch: “Where in the World Is Kellyanne Conway?”\n\nSasheer Zamata opened this very authentic recreation of PBS’ nostalgic kids’ game show, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? with one vital twist: We’re on the hunt for another elusive mystery woman, Kellyanne Conway. The show even brings out real kids for the sketch, who at one point inform everybody, “We don’t want to find her!” To top it off, we see McKinnon’s hilarious Conway creeping across the show’s logo.\n\nBest Short: “The Handmaid’s Tale”\n\nTapping into one of TV’s latest obsessions, the show successfully parodied The Handmaid’s Tale, putting four of SNL‘s female cast members — Cecily Strong, Vanessa Bayer, Aidy Bryant, and Sasheer Zamata — in the dystopian show’s trademark scarlet robes. The quartet encounters two dude-bros, played by Pine and Mikey Day, who know the women and wonder what they’ve been up to. When the maids inform them of their highly troubling predicament — society has stripped them of all their rights — the guys respond with something like, “I think I read something about that… but I’ve been super busy with work lately.” Damn. The short wins points for visual accuracy alone.\n\nWeakest Short: “World Peace Rap”\n\nIn the show’s most misguided musical sequence, Beck Bennett becomes someone named Stav D, who sings about the war and injustice of 2017. Chris Pine as a weird backup singer who looks like a rejected extra from True Blood and an inexplicable shift to singing about Stav D’s uncontrollable porn and masturbation addiction don’t help.\n\nWeekend Update Highlights\n\nColin Jost started off the segment by pointing out the American Health Care Act was approved by several congressmen who admit they never read the bill in the first place. “They’re treating healthcare the way I treat an iTunes agreement,” he quipped.\n\nChe then commented on Trump’s quote praising Australia’s healthcare system, wondering, “Why don’t we just do what they did? Instead, we’re like, ‘Yeah, you got any more of those Hemsworths, though?'” he joked.\n\nHe continued ragging on Trump, noting the president’s mention that he would be honored to meet Kim Jong-un of North Korea. “Maybe Trump meeting with crazy dictators isn’t such a bad thing,” Che said. “We finally have a president who speaks fluent maniac.”\n\nAfter some, uh, bumpy weather with Vanessa Bayer’s nervous, one-note weatherwoman Dawn Lazarus (who shows up twice), Leslie Jones saves the day, telling Jost a story about a vacation to Jamaica where she found some loving, smoked some weed, and lathered herself up in coconut oil. “Would you say you sorta got your groove back?” Jost offered. “Never say that again,” Jones insisted with her signature gravitas and intensity. “Look at me: Never.” Later, she almost cracks when she’s recounting to Jost what it’s like to have sex on the beach with crabs watching.\n\nBest Musical Moment: “Call the Police”\n\nNew York-based band LCD Soundsystem finally took the SNL stage, where they performed two tracks off their upcoming untitled album. The first song, the frenetic “Call the Police,” had frontman James Murphy channeling Morrissey — but his bandmate Gavin Russom put on the real show, joyfully busting moves in the background as he tapped away at his synthesizer.","author":"Dan Heching","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T17:53:29.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i1.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/nup_178441_0114.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C2700px%2C1418px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"NS3IrMqByjrq/vlxYOMELA==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"590f70cb522ffcfb9a9ac58e"},"description":"Lito conquers gay Hollywood, and Capheus makes an explosive political debut.","title":"'Sense8' Recap: From Queer to Eternity","url":"http://ew.com/recap/sense8-season-2-episode-10/","text":"On most shows, romantic story lines require conflict to stay interesting. You can only spend so many seasons watching Jim and Pam flirt and fall in love on The Office, and once two soulmates are an item, writers often have to throw in contrivances to give them some drama (I’m looking at you, April Nardini on Gilmore Girls). For all its silliness and camp, Sense8 is that rare show that affirms solid, healthy relationships. In Nomanita and Litonando, we’re treated to visions of queer people who support and adore each other, without any trite love triangles. And with Will and Riley and Kala and Wolfgang, the growing bonds feel exciting, rather than threatening.\n\n“If All the World’s a Stage” may be the least BPO-heavy episode of the season. It feels like a part two to “What Family Actually Means,” in that it gives two or three of the cluster the chance to face defining moments in their personal lives — no big bads necessary. This week, Lito and Capheus stepped into the spotlight, but not before the rest of the sensates got to bond.\n\nKala is nearly finished replicating the psy-blocker pills, and she’s curious to see how Riley and Will are faring after the death of Will’s father. But she’s really got a more pressing question on her mind: What’s it like for them to be together in person? Though they’re speaking through psychic channels across the world, she and Riley might as well be two girlfriends getting drinks. “I never understood the word presence until we were together,” Riley says. And then, Tuppence Middleton gives in to a luminous smile so well deserved for her character. “It’s pretty amazing.”\n\nKala can’t wait anymore. She and Wolfgang finally confront their feelings in his grim key shop and on her divine roof. With a setting magic-hour sun behind them, they rub fingers, lock eyes, and kiss. That the two have chemistry is undeniable, but it’s so much richer this season now that Kala has really grown into herself. She even sneaks a few barbs his way, criticizing his tendency to solve problems by shooting people. “By the way,” she says, “the jury’s mostly still out on whether it’s a good solution for anything.”\n\nKala tells Wolfgang that if she lost him, her life would have no meaning. He’s tired of waiting and tells her that they have to meet. But she won’t have him in India, and Berlin is no longer safe. So they’ll run away together — but only after she tells Rajan. I really hope that telling him doesn’t involve opening Ajay’s extremely ominous present. As for where Kala and Wolfgang go, may I suggest that they hang out with Will and Riley in London? They could walk around, have four-way sex, plot to take down an evil shadow government conspiracy: just couples’ bonding.\n\nLito’s also at a turning point in his life, waiting to audition for Kit Wagner, a seemingly all-powerful gay screenwriter/producer. And, of course, he’s played by Andy Dick. I would kill to know what that phone call was like between Dick and Lana Wachowski. In typical Sense8 timing, Sun shows up in the middle of the audition, desperately in need of help. She’s been put in a pink wig and lined up with rows of identical servers (very Papa Song’s from Cloud Atlas) for her brother’s big gala. This is her one chance to take him down, and she can’t be exposed until the right moment. When the excessively maniacal events manager asks her to make a sidecar, she calls on Lito to save the day.\n\nWith love for his soul sister, he blinks out of the audition to make “the world’s best sidecar,” which involves lots of twisting and shaking from Miguel Ángel Silvestre. How much can I love this man? But by the time he sits down to resume his audition, he’s lost it. Luckily, Sun returns the favor and calls on her present truth to give him the line he needs. “I have always been alone,” she says, “even as a child. I am afraid I will always be alone because I don’t know how else to be.” Nailed it.\n\nLito, Hernando, and Dani head to Wagner’s house for a Hollywood pool party that makes the one in La La Land look pitiful. There’s shirtless bartenders and even Marc Jacobs, who for some reason is the costume designer on this indie romance. Marc and Kit don’t think Lito looks right for his character in Iberian Dreams, and they proceed through a silly makeover montage set to Goldfrapp. Does Miguel Ángel Silvestre — arguably the hottest man alive, who wears a wardrobe that I covet desperately — really need a makeover? By the time it’s over, he looks like a gay porn Newsie.\n\nBut regardless, he’s a star, and he finally gets to meet his romantic opposite in the movie, Blake Huntington, played by Cheyenne Jackson (this is becoming a roll call of former RuPaul’s Drag Race guest judges). It seems that everybody’s smitten with Blake, and he even charms Hernando with some intellectual observations on Lito’s roles. I hope he sticks around to either throw Dani a bone or join a naked party in the Mexican sex condo.\n\nLito visits a smartly dressed Capheus, all suited up for his first big speech as a political candidate. “You’re looking very good,” Lito adoringly grins at him. They’re both feeling out of place in their new looks — this isn’t really them. Look, it’s no secret that I’ll wish for any physical contact between the sensates at any time, no questions asked. But besides my desire to see Miguel Ángel Silvestre and Toby Onwumure go at it, I felt like not letting the characters show each other some physical affection was a wasted opportunity. The orgy scene in “Demons” opened the door for the cluster to fully lose themselves in one another. Just because everyone is more or less coupled off doesn’t mean that they can’t share love. Aren’t those sorts of boundaries for the sapiens?","author":"David Goldberg","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T17:00:13.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i2.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/sense8_210_unit_00855_r_crop21.jpg?crop=0px%2C5px%2C2700px%2C1419px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"Y9zwjvE1cvnEdLvZmX2P2w==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"590f70cc522ffcfb9a9ac591"},"description":"‘Alien: Covenant’ reviews: Ridley Scott returns to the series’ roots","title":"‘Alien: Covenant’ reviews: Ridley Scott returns to the series’ roots","url":"http://ew.com/movies/2017/05/07/alien-covenant-reviews-roundup/","text":"Alien: Covenant sees director Ridley Scott return to the film franchise he so memorably kicked off with 1979’s Alien, a science fiction classic that introduced the world to Sigourney Weaver’s cinematic icon Ripley — and this time, Scott is taking the now 38-year-old film series in new directions.\n\nUnlike some of its more critically panned predecessors (Alien 3, plus both Alien vs. Predator 1 and 2), Scott’s latest flick, which follows 2012’s better received Prometheus, has already screened to more positive reviews, having scored a 77 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. That’s slightly lower for the franchise — Alien and Aliens both sit at 97 and 98 percent, respectively — but it’s still miles ahead from AvP 2‘s series low of 12 percent. So will Covenant be able to give fans of the original films what they’re hoping for? According to critics who’ve screened the film, it appears so.\n\n“Gross-outs and gotchas are fun, but they wouldn’t amount to much if Covenant wasn’t so thoroughly well-crafted. The performances are believable, and for the most part, the humans act like humans (except when they’re devious robots),” says EW’s Kevin P. Sullivan in his B+ review. “Much like The Force Awakens did with the first Star Wars, Covenant succeeds by recreating what it feels like to watch Alien. The tropes it plays with are the ones the original created. Here, they’re reproduced so slickly that you remember why you fell in love in the first place.”\n\nCovenant follows the story of the crew of the titular colony ship as they decide to veer off course to what they think is a new planetary paradise, one that is years closer than their intended destination. However, upon touching down, they meet David (Michael Fassbender reprising his role from Prometheus), the only survivor of a failed expedition. They then face off against an alien life form that threatens their survival.\n\nBefore Alien: Covenant hits theaters nationwide on May 19, check out review excerpts below.\n\nKevin P. Sullivan (EW):\n\n“Covenant is an Alien movie made for 2017. It doesn’t have the original’s restraint or eerie quietness. There’s probably more footage of the xenomorph in the trailer for Covenant than in entire ’79 Alien. But the update also speeds things up. The movie understands that the audience knows exactly where the story is going, so it gets there quickly. It’s not going to slow down to give Crewmember #4’s demise some (or any) dramatic weight.”\n\nBilge Ebiri (Village Voice):\n\n“Covenant could have continued in this vein and delivered a perfectly serviceable action-horror sequel. But Scott has bigger plans. He wants to do so much here: probe the nature of faith and the mysteries of creation, examine the limits of humanity and intelligence, compare visions of leadership and devotion. And, as in earlier Alien movies, Covenant explores the notion of a post-human universe — in which people are afterthoughts or, at most, cumbersome bottlenecks between the more powerful forces of capitalism and creation, between survival and space. The whole series is kind of about this. But Alien: Covenant might be the first to state the theme outright.”\n\nPeter Bradshaw (The Guardian):\n\n“The vu has never been so déja: it’s a greatest-hits compilation of the other Alien films’ freaky moments. The paradox is that though you are intended to recognise these touches, you won’t really be impressed unless you happen to be seeing them for the first time. For all this, the film is very capably made, with forceful, potent performances from Waterston and Fassbender. That franchise title is, however, looking increasingly wrong. It is a bit familiar.”\n\nMike Ryan (UPROXX):\n\n“There was a chance Alien: Covenant was going to get back to basics, but Ridley Scott had a lot more to say about David and to show us why these aliens exist. Look, Scott obviously still has a lot he wants to say about the mythology of Alien — wrapped up in a creator complex story featuring a bored robot — and that’s what he’s going to do. The title of the movie has been changed back to Alien, but this is very much a Prometheus movie. And if you didn’t like Prometheus, there’s a good chance you won’t like Alien: Covenant either. (In turn, if you did like Prometheus, boy, do I have some good news for you.) What’s frustrating is this could have been a pretty stellar Alien movie.“\n\nCath Clarke (Time Out London):\n\n“Covenant has the same beautiful design as Prometheus and once again the script is being all clever and profound, asking the biggies: Who are we? Where do we come from? What’s missing is one of the franchise’s unforgettable scenes that feed your nightmares for weeks — like Noomi Rapace’s do-it-yourself alien caesarian in Prometheus, or the chestbuster in Alien. And every time a crew member stiffened, an alien about to burst out of them like a blackhead being popped, my mind drifted back to the original.”\n\nAlonso Duralde (The Wrap):\n\n“Boiled down to the basics, the Alien movies are monster movie/slasher movie hybrids. Over the years, we’ve seen variations on this theme — the 1979 original is a moody, sterling example of both genres, Aliens plays up the action elements, and Prometheus noodles out some philosophical ruminations on life, the universe, man’s need for deities, and who put the bomp in the bomp-she-bomp — but these films all boil down to terrified, hauntingly-lit human beings having gross encounters with those deadly, acid-blooded beasties. Alien: Covenant almost completely gives itself over to the scary stuff; director Ridley Scott dredges up a little of the Prometheus balloon juice (this film is a direct follow-up to that prequel), but he’s more interested in an interstellar version of Friday the 13th, with a respectable ensemble of actors as the camp counselors and various fanged slimeballs filling in for Jason Voorhees.”\n\nTodd McCarthy (Hollywood Reporter):\n\n“Scott and the writers have achieved an outstanding balance in Alien: Covenant among numerous different elements: Intelligent speculation and textbook sci-fi presumptions, startlingly inventive action and audience-pleasing old standbys, philosophical considerations and inescapable genre conventions, intense visual splendor and gore at its most grisly. The drama flows gorgeously and, unlike in many other franchises in which entries keep getting longer every time out, this one is served up without an ounce of fat. It provides all the tension and action the mainstream audience could want, along with a good deal more.”\n\nPeter Debruge (Variety):\n\n“In an effort to appease Alien fans, Scott has returned the series to its horror-movie roots, unleashing a sequence of gory death scenes as four aliens body-snatch and otherwise terrorize the crew. By now, though, audiences are so familiar with how this species reproduces that there’s not much surprise between the point of infection (whether by microscopic spores or old-fashioned face hugging) and the moment that an alien embryo bursts out of the host’s chest. If anything, an impatience sets in, much as it does with zombie movies in which characters aren’t up to speed on the genre rules: In the world of Alien, humans don’t recover from these close encounters; once someone catches the virus, he or she is already a goner.”","author":"Nivea Serrao","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T16:50:09.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i1.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/alien-covenant-df-14740_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"CyGdkASBnK0C56RPRQc9Zw==\n"}

The renewal comes as no surprise considering the show’s success, as well as the many cliffhangers left to resolve at the conclusion of the season 1 finale.\n\n“I think that there’s potential to know more about these characters and I think that there are good stories to be told,” Minnette, who plays lead character Clay, told EW before the renewal announcement.\n\nRELATED: Why the 13 Reasons Why Cast Looks So Familiar\n\nThe majority of the show’s stars, including Langford and Minnette, are expected to appear at the 2017 MTV Movie \u0026 TV Awards on Sunday night, where they will present an award. While they’re not up for anything — the nominations were announced just days after 13 Reasons Why debuted on Netflix — something tells us the cast will be in quite the celebratory mood.","author":"Samantha Highfill","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T15:17:50.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i2.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/13rw_109_01140r.jpg?crop=0px%2C34px%2C2700px%2C1419px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"A7I4ySSMncxJS6uR2AN40Q==\n"}

The Madison Square Garden concert took place in April 2011 and was chronicled in documentary Shut Up and Play the Hits.\n\nAfter a five-year hiatus, LCD Soundsystem returned to the music scene in 2016 to headline festivals including Coachella and Lollapalooza.

Fortunately, it seems Wachowski HQ knew they were throwing us for a loop with that last episode and wisely gave us “What Family Actually Means,” a sweeter, slower chapter that gave the sensates the chance to shed tears rather than spill blood. Will and Nomi, the original best bros of the series, get the most spotlight here, but there’s plenty of scene stealing to be had for Dani and Amanita.\n\nBut before we get to the weddings, deathbeds, and Hollywood deals, let’s go over the developments in the BPO storyline. Riley and Diego finally clock the identity of her mysterious Archipelago informant: Carol Cumberland. Diego — still cute and still very necessary as a balance for the seriousness of this X-Files story line — can’t help but come along with Riley to visit Carol’s house. They find a basement lab with a hidden room that would make even Harry Potter squirm for air. Apparently, Whispers and Angelica brought Raoul here for zombification, and it seems that neither she nor Carol could live with what they did. Carol takes her life (after an unexplained visit from Jonas), and Riley and Diego find her in the bathtub.\n\nIn light of the last paragraph, this may seem in bad taste, but can we talk about how good Daryl Hannah looks in actual clothes? After a season and a Christmas special spent in that raggedy nightie, Ms. Thing is back, rocking some JFK Jr.-era knitwear and a fly rose satin dress. I’ll sit through any number of grim flashbacks to see Angelica serving it as an evil ecologist.\n\nIn San Francisco, Nomi has to face her family at her sister Tegan’s rehearsal dinner. Her hilariously brittle mother suggests it would be best if Nomi “had one of your mysterious headaches and left early.” It’s on. She takes the mic and shares the story of how Tegan didn’t tell their parents about Nomi’s transition (even after Nomi forged her mother’s signature to authorize surgery) and how Tegan’s was the first face Nomi saw when she woke up from the operation. As always, Nomi tends to talk about herself a bit too much, but in the end she speaks volumes for how vital support from biological family can be to a queer person.\n\nOf course, by the time the wedding rolls around, we know she’s not going to get this lucky twice in a row. Like clockwork, Agent Bendix waits outside the chapel, ready to pounce. Nomi walks down the aisle with a douche groomsman, who has the nerve to crack at her: “That’s a nice wrack for a dude.” Sun shows up, just when we need her, to support her sister. “Do you want me to hurt him?” And with a crack of a finger, the queer family scores another small victory.\n\nBut before the big ceremony can go off without a hitch, Bendix busts in, stops the whole show, and calls for Nomi to step down and face the law. And here’s when Freema Agyeman reminds us that she’s the best. Just as Nomi steps down to leave with Bendix, Neets and a surprisingly dapper Bug run up to the aisle to shut it down. “Good citizens of San Francisco’s upper tax bracket!” she proclaims, injecting this WASP wedding with her irresistible joie de vivre. “This man, Agent Jeffrey Bendix, has stormed into the middle of this sacred ceremony, violating this important moment for absolutely no reason than the gratification of his male ego!” Get it, lady.\n\nNeets challenges Bendix to pull up his warrant, which, thanks to Bug and the V for Vendetta dude, doesn’t exist. And from here, we’re treated to the kind of rich reconciliation fantasy that most queer viewers would say is contrived — but that we totally cry over anyway. Nomi’s dad steps up to the agent and gives the classic shutdown: “Get your hands off my daughter.” It’s perfect, Neets is perfect, and, despite all the moralistic obstacles and awkwardness of family, love somehow does win, and not in the way any of the Marks clan expected it to.","author":"David Goldberg","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T14:00:46.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i2.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/sense8_209_unit_02183_r_crop1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"JKs8GKbQM7MWq+8gitHxPg==\n"}

When Megan Morrison quite literally signed on the dotted line in order to date movie star Kyle West, she had no idea that their story would end up being more about love than anything else … at least in the beginning.\n\nBut as the season now heads into its season finale, the love story takes a bit of a backseat. Not only did Megan recently reveal that she killed her step-brother after he sexually assaulted her when they were young, but the penultimate episode ended with Megan being kidnapped by the Institute of the Higher Mind.\n\n“For me, selling people on the relationship was crucial. If you didn’t really buy in and get emotionally attached to those two, then everything that happens to them has less impact,” showrunner Jonathan Abrahams tells EW. “It was intentional to start meshing everything more toward the end of the season. It was always part of my plan to kind of slow burn Terence and the Institute as the big bad. A lot of [the show] is exploration of relationships and intimacy and you really have to give that weight. There’s plenty of time for Terence to be evil. We got to it, hopefully, at exactly the right time.”\n\nRELATED: The 25 Best TV Characters in the Past 25 Years\n\nSpecifically, the finale will find Megan having to face not only the institute, but herself. “I would describe the finale as an exploration of self under extreme circumstances,” Abrahams says. “Most of the time, when it comes to relationships, we put the cart before the horse. We focus on this other person — what they have and what they don’t have — and then you realize, ‘I haven’t done any of this work on myself.’ In a broadly thematic way, it seems very appropriate — after this period of time being with somebody, suddenly you’re examining your own stuff. In this case, Megan isn’t necessarily doing it by choice, but it seems like an appropriate pit stop along the way.”\n\nA pit stop along the way to what is the question.\n\nThe Arrangement finale airs Sunday, May 7 at 10 p.m. ET on E!","author":"Samantha Highfill","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T13:30:33.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i1.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/arrangement.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C2700px%2C1418px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"hJ+Focpbnbb3TdKCGOpE/A==\n"}

Far-right leader Le Pen has conceded.","title":"Macron to become next French president after beating back Le Pen and her populist tide","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/with-europe-on-the-line-polarized-french-voters-choose-between-macron-and-le-pen/2017/05/07/ccf8e5e2-31d9-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html","text":"France on Sunday shrugged off the siren call of right-wing populism that enchanted voters in the United States and United Kingdom, rejecting anti-E.U. firebrand Marine Le Pen and choosing as its next president Emmanuel Macron, a centrist political neophyte who has pledged to revive both his struggling country and the flailing continent.\n\nThe result brought to a close a tumultuous and polarized campaign that defied prediction at nearly every turn, though not at the end. Pre-election polls had forecast a sizable Macron victory, and he appeared to have delivered, with projections issued after polls closed showing him with around 65 percent of the vote.\n\nIn a statement to the AFP news service, Macron said the country had “turned a new page in our long history. I want it to be a page of hope and renewed trust.”\n\nHe was expected to deliver a victory speech later Sunday night in the grand courtyard of Paris’s Louvre Museum, where news of his win spawned raucous cheers among thousands of flag-waving Macron backers.\n\n“I feel relieved,” said Valentin Coutouly, a 23-year-old student who described himself as “European to the core” and who was celebrating on a chilly May night. “I think we were all afraid that Le Pen could actually win. We realized in the end that it was possible.”\n\n(Reuters)\n\nAt her own gathering at a Paris restaurant, a downcast Le Pen conceded defeat, telling her demoralized supporters that the country had “chosen continuity” and said the election had drawn clear lines between “the patriots and the globalists.”\n\nThe outcome will soothe Europe’s anxious political establishment, which had feared a Le Pen victory would throw in reverse decades of efforts to forge continental integration.\n\nBut it instantly puts pressure on Macron to deliver on promises made to an unhappy French electorate, including reform of two institutions notoriously resistant to change: the European Union and the French bureaucracy.\n\nAt 39, the trim, blue-eyed and square-jawed Macron will become France’s youngest leader since Napoleon when he is inaugurated this weekend, and his election caps an astonishing rise.\n\nWith a background in investment banking and a turn as economy minister under a historically unpopular president, he may have seemed an ill fit for the anti-establishment anger coursing through Western politics.\n\nBut by bucking France’s traditional parties and launching his own movement – En Marche, or Onward -- Macron managed to cast himself as the outsider the country needs. And by unapologetically embracing the European Union, immigration and the multicultural tableau of modern France, he positioned himself as the optimistic and progressive antidote to the dark and reactionary vision of Le Pen’s National Front.\n\nLe Pen, 48, has long sought to become the first far-right leader elected in Western Europe’s post-war history. Sunday’s vote frustrated those ambitions, but is unlikely to end them.\n\nA woman votes at the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in London. (Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBy winning around 35 percent of the vote, she nearly doubled the share won by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in the 2002 election, the only other time the National Front’s candidate has made it to the second round. The result seemed to cement the party’s long march from the political fringe to the center of the nation’s unhappy political discourse, if not the pinnacle of its power.\n\nStruggling with chronically high unemployment and recurrent terrorist attacks, France’s mood on the day of its presidential vote was reflected in the dark clouds and chilly spring rains that blanketed much of the country.\n\nNonetheless, the public voted at a rate that would be the envy of many Western democracies: From the chic neighborhoods of Paris to the struggling post-industrial towns of the French countryside, turnout nationwide was expected to reach 75 percent, down slightly from previous votes.\n\nNo matter whom French voters picked, the choice was bound to be historic.\n\nThe dominant two parties of France’s Fifth Republic were both eliminated in the first round. The center-left Socialists were decimated, brought low by the failure of current President Francois Hollandeto turn around the economy or to prevent a succession of mass-casualty terrorist attacks.\n\nThe center-right Republicans, meanwhile, missed what was once seen as a sure-fire bet at returning to power after their candidate, former prime minister Francois Fillon, was hobbled by a series of corruption allegations.\n\nThe two candidates who remained, Le Pen and Macron, both traced an outsider’s path as they sought residence at the Élysée Palace.\n\nOf the two, Macron had the more direct route. But his campaign still had to overcome all the usual challenges of a start-up, plus some extraordinary ones — including the publication online Friday night of thousands of hacked campaign documents in a cyber-attack that aroused suspicions of Russian meddling.\n\nThe outcome of Sunday’s vote will have profound implications not only for France’s 67 million citizens, but also for the future of Europe and for the political trajectory across the Western world.\n\nAfter a pair of dramatic triumphs for the populist right in 2016 – with Brexit in the U.K., and Donald Trump in the U.S. – France’s vote was viewed as a test of whether the political mainstream could beat back a rising tide.\n\nMany of Europe’s mainstream leaders -- both center-right and center-left – lined up to cheer Macron on after he punched his ticket to the second round in a vote last month. The endorsements were a break from protocol for presidents and prime ministers who normally stay out of each other’s domestic elections.\n\nBut they reflected the gravity of the choice that France faced. A victory by Le Pen was seen as a possible market-rattling death blow to decades of efforts to draw Europe more closely together, with the country’s new president expected to lead campaigns to take the country out of both the E.U. and the euro.\n\nFormer U.S. president Barack Obama had also endorsed Macron, and the young French politician often appeared to be trying to emulate the magic of Obama’s 2008 campaign with speeches that appealed to hope, change and unity -- while eliding many of the details of his policies.\n\nThe current White House occupant, Trump, was cagey about his choice, saying before the first round that Le Pen was “the strongest on borders and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France.” He predicted that she would do well, but stopped short of endorsing her.\n\nOn the campaign trail this spring, Le Pen’s rhetoric had often echoed Trump’s, with vows to put “France first” and to defend “the forgotten France.” She also condemned globalist cosmopolitans – Macron chief among them -- who she said did not have the nation’s interests at heart.\n\nBut she had distanced herself from Trump since his inauguration, often declining to mention him by name, and analysts said her association with the unpopular American president may have hurt her among French voters.\n\nMacron shares almost nothing with Trump except one key fact: Like the New York real estate tycoon, Macron became president of his country on his first run for elective office.\n\nThe son of doctors who was raised in the northern city of Amiens, Macron had to teach himself the basics of campaigning on the fly in the white-hot glare of a presidential race.\n\nVowing repeatedly during the campaign to borrow from both left and right, he will now have to learn how to govern a country without the backing of any of its traditional parties.\n\nInstead, he has a movement that he built from scratch, and now faces the immediate challenge of getting En Marche allies elected to the National Assembly.\n\nThat vote, due next month, will determine whether Macron has the parliamentary support he needs to enact an agenda of sweeping economic reforms, many of which are likely to unsettle the country’s deeply entrenched labor unions.\n\nDespite his victory, pre-election polls showed that most of Macron’s supporters saw themselves voting against Le Pen rather than for him.\n\nThat was reflected on the streets Sunday, with voters even in well-to-do and heavily pro-Macron neighborhoods of Paris saying they felt more resigned than excited.\n\n“On the one hand you have a far-right party that will take us straight to disaster,” said Gilbert Cohen, a retired 82-year-old engineer who cast his ballot amid the vaulted ceilings of Paris’s 17th century Place des Vosges, a former royal residence that was also home to Victor Hugo. “On the other, you have the candidate who’s the only reasonable choice we have.”\n\nCohen described Macron as “brilliant.” But, he said, the new boy wonder of French politics “can’t govern by himself.”\n\nElsewhere in France, the mood was even more markedly downbeat. In Laon, a small and struggling city 90 miles north of Paris, many voters said they were so disillusioned by the choice that they would cast a blank ballot.\n\nOthers said their disenchantment had led them to Le Pen – and a hope that, despite the polls, she could still eke out a victory that would bring the radical break for France that they crave.\n\n“We’ve had 50 years of rule from the left and the right,” said Francis Morel, a 54-year-old bread maker who cast his ballot for Le Pen. “Nothing has changed.”\n\nThe mood was considerably more upbeat Sunday night at the Louvre, where Macron supporters gathered in what was once the seat of French kings for their candidate’s victory celebration.\n\nStéphanie Ninel, 31, a technician, said she had been at the Louvre since just after lunchtime, braving the chilly weather to snag a prime position in the crowd.\n\n“I’ve been old enough to vote in three elections now,” she said. “But this is the first time I feel I’ve been able to vote for someone with actual conviction. He’s a new person, and he demands a new politics.”\n\nStanley-Becker reported from Laon and McAuley from Paris.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) said on ABC’s “This Week,” adding that the Senate would be “starting from scratch.” (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nSeveral Republican leaders on Sunday formed a political barricade around the health-care bill that narrowly passed the House last week, defending how the legislation would change insurance coverage for people with preexisting illness or injury.\n\nBut while House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Trump administration officials rallied around the House legislation after intense criticism from Democrats, who say the bill would strip protections, moderate Senate Republicans were outright dismissive.\n\n“The House bill is not going to come before us,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said on ABC’s “This Week,” adding that the Senate would be “starting from scratch.”\n\nThe Republican split-screen on health care revealed the frothing, nerve-inducing debate within the party about how to gut aspects of the Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010 and whose demise has been a promise by the Republican Party to its conservative base.\n\nA growing number of Senate Republicans are recasting President Trump’s Rose Garden celebration after the House vote as a mere starting point because of anxiety over how the House bill would affect Medicaid recipients in their states, insurance costs for people with conditions such as diabetes or cancer, or the breadth of health benefits in states that would be able to jettison current federal insurance requirements.\n\nYet Trump and many of his allies continue to doggedly talk up the House bill, resisting the suggestion that the Senate could discard major items in the legislation, which was crafted with inputs from the hard-line House Freedom Caucus.\n\nAnd many of them remain defiant amid the barrage of attacks from Democrats, who have insisted that the House bill would make acquiring coverage more difficult for people with serious ailments and disrupt insurance markets — and see in the Republicans’ efforts a chance to reclaim the House majority next year.\n\n[House Republicans claim a major victory with passage of health-care overhaul]\n\nThe seemingly divergent political positioning on display Sunday underscored the fragility of the Republican Party on an issue that has galvanized them for years. Senate Republicans, generally more centrist in their politics, do not feel compelled to herald the House bill. But House Republicans and White House advisers, who are more skittish about fraying the relationships they have cultivated with House conservatives and activists, do not want to shelve or play down the bill that just passed.\n\nRyan, for instance, offered a spirited defense of the House bill on ABC’s “This Week” as he was peppered with questions about the possibility of sharp premium increases for people with preexisting conditions and the worry that many people on Medicaid will lose their coverage.\n\nRyan described the House bill as a “rescue operation” meant to address what he characterized as a badly failing Affordable Care Act.\n\n“We will want to make sure people who have bad health-care status, who have a preexisting condition, get affordable coverage,” Ryan said. “That’s not happening in Obamacare. You got to remember, if you can’t even get a health insurance plan, what good is it? You don’t have health insurance.”\n\nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus acknowledged GOP House members could face some criticism but predicted they would ultimately be “rewarded” by voters for having addressed what he described as the failures of the current health-care law.\n\n“Sometimes in life you have to do what’s right, not what’s politically expedient,” Priebus said during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nHow the GOP ultimately moves forward this spring and the internecine wrangling over the scope of the final congressional product will have sweeping consequences for the health-care system. With Republicans controlling both chambers in Congress and the White House, the lingering question for them is not whether to repeal some provisions of the law but whether the Senate or House will hold sway on the details.\n\n“We’re going to go through that process,” White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said on CBS’s “Face the Nation. “Is it ugly? Maybe. Is it slow? Yes, but it’s the right way to do it, and it’s how we’re going to handle this bill.”\n\n[Trump crows about his health care victory — even though he hasn’t really won yet]\n\nTrump — who on Sunday largely remained out of public view at his secluded private golf club in Bedminster, N.J.. and planned to return in the evening to Washington — has urged the Senate to act but said little about what amendments, if any, he would support.\n\n“Republican Senators will not let the American people down! ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up — it was a lie and it is dead!” Trump tweeted Sunday.\n\nFor now, Senate Republicans are signaling that they are in control after weeks of tumult within the House. Collins, along with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), have in recent days spoken out forcefully against parts of the House bill, with Graham saying it “needs to be viewed with suspicion” and Portman asserting that “it does not meet the test of stability” for people who rely on the “safety net” of Medicaid.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that he and his colleagues would “come up with what the Senate thinks the Senate can do.”\n\nBlunt, who is close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said the Senate GOP will wait to review a score of the legislation’s cost from the Congressional Budget Office before moving ahead with any vote. The House GOP did not have the final version of their bill scored last week, but it was reviewed in prior forms, with the CBO concluding that 24 million more Americans would lack health insurance by 2026 if that bill became law.\n\n“The Senate is going to complete the job of saying just how much more money,” Ryan said on ABC. “This is one stage in a multistage legislative process. You know how this works. They pass a bill through the House. Then they pass a bill through the Senate and then you go to conference and iron out the differences.”\n\n[Public pans Republicans’ latest approach to replacing Affordable Care Act]\n\nPriebus argued that any concerns about people with preexisting conditions are overblown, stressing that nothing would change for people with coverage through their employer, Medicare and Medicaid. Even people in states where governors seek waivers will be affected only if they don’t have continuous coverage, he said, and there is money in the bill to help them.\n\n“We’ve put billions . . . into high-risk pools to buy down any premiums.” Priebus said, referencing a change to the House bill late last week that would provide $8 billion over five years to help people with preexisting conditions — including cancer, high blood pressure, asthma and even pregnancy sometimes — afford coverage. “If you have a preexisting condition, this president is not going to let you down.”\n\nPriebus said he talked Saturday with six Republicans who are part of the working group on the Senate version of the bill, called them “mature” and said he is confident in the changes they may make.\n\nThe talks at the moment mostly involve only Republicans. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been friendly with Trump, said Sunday that he was distressed that no Democrats have been asked to work on the bill in the Senate. A working group of 13 GOP senators from different parts of the ideological spectrum is meeting twice a week to talk about how to move ahead.\n\n“I’m the most centrist Democrat willing to work and fix things,” Manchin said on “Face the Nation.” He said people in his rural, working-class state would be “completely slammed” by the House bill.\n\nLeading health policy experts have questioned GOP claims and how they would work in practice. Among the most significant: How many states would back away from the federal protections for people with medical conditions? How many would cut back on a set of “essential benefits” that current law requires to be included in all health plans sold to individuals or small business? And how many people would lose coverage because of other changes in the House plan?\n\n[How the House got a health-care bill after Trump and Ryan stepped back]\n\nThere is no one meaning of “preexisting conditions,” but the term generally refers to acute or chronic ailments that a person has or had in the past and that might return. Such ailments often require more medical care than healthy people tend to use. Before the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the law that Trump and congressional Republicans are eager to dismantle, Americans with such medical challenges often could not get or afford insurance.\n\nAn estimated 50 million to 129 million Americans have some preexisting health problem, according to an analysis by federal health officials during the Obama administration.\n\nAs House Republicans fanned out across the country for a one-week recess, Mulvaney, a former House member from South Carolina, said lawmakers should be “ecstatic” about the chance to talk to their constituents about the legislation.\n\n“Absolutely, without reservation,” Mulvaney said. “That’s what I would do.”\n\nBut the public response has been decidedly mixed, as have lawmakers’ handling of the issue.\n\nWhen Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, held a town-hall meeting on Friday, he was pelted with boos and jeers.\n\n“Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care,” Labrador told the crowd, prompting an uproar that has since been replayed several times on cable television.\n\nAmy Goldstein contributed to this report.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/costareports","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T06:35:00.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/07/National-Politics/Images/Collins_Governor_64084-8942a.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"eU9Ub387DhpAUOc4+YScmg==\n"}

She said the project in Jersey City “means a lot to me and my entire family.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kushner has said that he has stepped back from the day-to-day operations of the family business. But government ethics filings show that he and Ivanka Trump, his wife and the president’s daughter, continue to benefit from Kushner Companies’ real estate and investment businesses, a stake worth as much as $600 million, and probably much more.\n\nThe Shanghai event, at the opulent Four Seasons Hotel, was patrolled by burly security guards who screened those in attendance and kept journalists outside, in an elevator lobby. The organizers had refused on Saturday to allow late registration as word spread of the Beijing event. One guard at the Shanghai event was heard saying that at least some of the participants would be leaving through a private back exit.\n\nBut some who attended described an investor pitch similar to the one in Beijing, and Mr. Trump’s political power was palpable at the Shanghai event even if his name went unsaid. As on Saturday in Beijing, one slide presented to the Shanghai audience on Sunday showed a photograph of Mr. Trump when describing who will decide the future of the visa program for foreign investors, according to a snapshot taken by an audience member.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Kushner Companies’ marketing push comes as Mr. Kushner is emerging as a crucial voice on China relations, brokering meetings between his father-in-law and top Chinese government officials.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile the Trump connection piqued the interest of many people in attendance, such events soliciting investors for projects in the United States are not unusual in China. The so-called EB-5 visa program awards foreign investors the right to live in the United States for two years and a path to permanent residency, in exchange for investments of at least $500,000 in American development projects. A bright red line near the top of the posters in the Four Seasons lobby prominently mentioned EB-5 visas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout three-quarters of the roughly 10,000 investor visas issued last year went to Chinese nationals.\n\nAlthough the program was created as a way to finance projects in economically troubled neighborhoods, it has instead turned into a form of cheap financing for luxury real estate developers. Applicants are primarily seeking the visa, so they do not seek a significant return on their investment.\n\nThe United States Government Accountability Office, the investigative branch of Congress, has criticized the visa program for its lax safeguards against illicit sources of money.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He divested his interests in that project by selling them to a family trust of which he is not a beneficiary, said Blake Roberts, a lawyer at WilmerHale who is advising Mr. Kushner on ethics issues.\n\nMr. Kushner has divested his stakes in dozens of entities used to hold family company investments, though he remains the beneficiary of trusts that hold stakes in hundreds of others.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Ms. Meyer wanted to make clear that her brother had stepped away from the company in January and has nothing to do with this project,” said Risa Heller, a Kushner Companies spokeswoman. “Kushner Companies apologizes if that mention of her brother was in any way interpreted as an attempt to lure investors. That was not Ms. Meyer’s intention.”\n\nMany in China start looking for overseas residency and passports after they have children. They fear the effects of smog on their children’s lungs — the smog was heavy in Shanghai on Sunday, and an internationally comparable index of air quality showed that the pollution was seven times the level in New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany families also consider overseas schools to be preferable to China’s, where ferocious academic competition keeps children doing homework until late at night even in elementary school, in preparation for a national college entrance exam that means riches or ruin.\n\n“I want my child to live in a relatively relaxed environment,” said Ms. Bi, who is 34 and expecting her first child, “where he or she could be himself or herself and lead a diverse life, instead of having no choice but to take the college entrance exam in China.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, she said, investing in the Kushner project would not give her and her husband enough time to get to the United States before her baby was born.\n\nMany people here worry that the window for obtaining an EB-5 visa may be closing.

He has said he will take a tough line on immigration, though he did not take aim at investors in real estate projects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Kushner project promoted to Chinese investors, called Kushner 1, includes two towers and nearly 1,500 luxury apartments, with construction to begin early next year.","author":"Keith Bradsher, Ailin Tang and Jesse Drucker","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T17:57:33.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/07/world/08KUSHNER/08KUSHNER-facebookJumbo.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"+L+rAdHeKbzkFNGG0Ebszg==\n"}

This would bring the tally to four U.S. citizens held by the reclusive nation.\n\n“The relevant authority is currently carrying out a detailed investigation into the crime of Kim Hak Song,” Korean Central News Agency said. The report did not specify the nature of the “hostile acts” or offer any further information about Kim.\n\nOfficials confirmed Wednesday they also were holding an accounting instructor tied to the school, which was founded by evangelical Christians in 2010. They said Kim Sang Dok, who also goes by the name Tony Kim, was arrested at the Pyongyang airport for “hostile criminal acts” intended to subvert the country.\n\nState media did not say whether the two detentions were connected.\n\nA State Department official said the agency was aware of reports about the arrest and considers the security of U.S. citizens one of its “highest priorities.” The agency declined to comment further, citing privacy considerations.\n\nBecause the U.S. has no embassy in North Korea, Sweden assists with consular matters involving American citizens.\n\nThis file photo taken Feb. 29, 2016, and released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agen STR / AFP/Getty Images This file photo taken Feb. 29, 2016, and released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency shows U.S. student Otto Frederick Warmbier speaking at a news conference in Pyongyang.

It also sentenced Korean American businessman Kim Dong Chul to 10 years of hard labor for espionage charges.\n\nOfficials have held Canadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim since 2015.\n\nThe latest arrest came days after American officials pressed the United Nations for stronger sanctions to thwart North Korea’s nuclear weapons ambitions. The U.S. also recently directed an aircraft carrier strike group toward the Korean Peninsula.\n\n“Failing to act now on the most pressing security issue in the world may bring catastrophic consequences,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the United Nations Security Council in late April.\n\nNorth Korea tested two ballistic missiles in recent weeks, both of which flubbed.\n\nThe country is trying to build a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the U.S and, according to analysts, soon may conduct its sixth nuclear test.\n\nBoth countries have heightened their rhetoric in recent weeks.\n\nU.S. President Trump last month warned of the potential for a “major, major conflict” with the isolated nation and has not ruled out military action.\n\nNorth Korea on Friday accused the CIA of attempting to assassinate leader Kim Jong Un using a biochemical substance. The country’s ministry of state security said in a statement that the spy agency bribed a North Korean man named Kim to carry out the deed.\n\nThe statement said North Korea recently “uncovered and smashed” a “heinous crime” that is a form of terrorism and “an act of mangling the future of humankind.”\n\nNorth Korea’s media, which enjoys bluster and strongman rhetoric, also has taken a rare swing at China — its main economic benefactor. China suspended coal imports to the country earlier this year, and its state media has warned of stronger sanctions should North Korea attempt another nuclear test.\n\nA commentary released last week by KCNA called these “reckless remarks” and warned such antagonism could trigger “grave consequences.”\n\nSunday’s claim of detainment follows the April 22 arrest of Kim Sang Dok, a former accounting instructor at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, the KCNA said. It said he was intercepted at Pyongyang International Airport “for committing criminal acts” to overthrow the North’s government.\n\nThe Pyongyang university is the only privately funded university in North Korea and is unique for having a large number of foreign staff.\n\nWashington, Seoul and others often accuse North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions, which in recent years have involved high-profile American missions sent to secure the release of the Americans.\n\nNorth Korea’s announcement of the detainments comes amid tensions over fears that Pyongyang is preparing another round of nuclear or missile tests and comments. Trump has further spiked animosity by saying he isn’t ruling out military action against the North, although Trump also has said he would be willing to talk with Kim Jong Un under the right circumstances.\n\nTimes staff writer Laura King in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nMeyers is a special correspondent.\n\nTwitter: @jessicameyers\n\nALSO\n\nIn a rare direct criticism, North Korea says China's 'reckless remarks' are testing its patience\n\nHere's what's driving North Korea's nuclear program — and it might be more than self-defense\n\nPassing 100-day mark, Trump offers mixed signals on healthcare, taxes and North Korea\n\nUPDATES:\n\n10 a.m.: This article has been updated throughout with staff reporting.\n\nThis article was originally published at 6:50 a.m.","author":"Jessica Meyers","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T18:02:30.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-590f6135/turbine/la-fg-north-korea-detains-american-20170507","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"C+PluZI4HWePZVRksBgt1w==\n"}

The fraternity itself is facing charges including involuntary manslaughter and hazing.\n\nOn the morning of Feb. 3, police were called to the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house, where Piazza was found unconscious, about 12 hours after he fell down the stairs. Piazza was hospitalized and pronounced dead in the early hours of Feb. 4, according to the Centre County, Pennsylvania, grand jury investigation report released today.\n\nHere is how the night of Feb. 2 and early morning hours of Feb. 3 unfolded at Beta Theta Pi, according to the report, which cited evidence including video from surveillance cameras, testimony and phone records.\n\nOn the night of Feb. 2, Piazza engaged in drinking as a part of a pledge ritual and his blood alcohol content reached between .28 and .36.\n\nHis fall was not captured on surveillance cameras but someone heard it, and when one man went to the top of the basement stairs, he saw Piazza lying face-down at the bottom of the steps. In a group message to other fraternity brothers at 11:53 p.m. that night, that man wrote, \"Tim Piazza might actually be a problem. He fell 15 feet down a flight of stairs, hair-first, going to need help.\"\n\nSurveillance video at 10:47 p.m. showed Piazza being carried upstairs by four fraternity brothers; in the video, his body appeared limp, his eyes were closed, he appeared unconscious and a bruise was visible on his side. Piazza was placed on a couch and liquid was dumped on his face twice, but he didn't respond either time.\n\nAbout a half an hour after the fall, at 11:14 p.m., a newly initiated member saw Piazza lying on the couch, looking \"horrible,\" he later told the grand jury. He saw Piazza \"thrashing and making weird movements on the couch\" and screamed at the fraternity brothers for help, stressing that Piazza needed to go to the hospital because he could have a concussion. One brother shoved the newly initiated member into a wall and said they had it under control.\n\nAt 11:25 p.m., the pledge master slapped Piazza three times in the face. At 11:37 p.m., one fraternity brother tackled another brother into the couch, physically landing on top of Piazza.\n\nBy 1 a.m., some brothers saw Piazza vomit and twitch on the couch. Three brothers filled a backpack with books and placed it on Piazza to try to keep him from rolling to his back if he passed out. At 1:48 a.m., Piazza rolled off the couch and to the floor, and three brothers picked him up and \"slammed him onto the couch.\" One brother hit Piazza hard once in the abdomen.\n\nBy 2:38 a.m., Piazza rolled to the floor and at 3:16 p.m. his legs were moving. At 3:22 p.m., Piazza tried to stand and the backpack came off and he fell back, hitting his head on the hardwood floor. A fraternity brother attempted to shake him for a moment and then left the room.\n\nAt 3:46 a.m., Piazza was curled up on the floor in the fetal position with his knees toward his chest. At 3:49 a.m., Piazza positioned himself on his knees, bent over with his elbows on the floor and his head in his hands. At 3:54 a.m., he tried to stand but fell face-down onto the floor. At 4:59 a.m., he stood and then fell head-first into an iron railing, landing on a stone floor.\n\n\"He gets up again and attempts to go to the front door but before he reaches it he falls head-first into the door,\" the grand jury report says. He later rolled to his side, clutching his abdomen.\n\nAt 5:15 a.m., one brother came into the room, stepped over the injured pledge, looked at him and then left the room. At 5:26 a.m., another brother saw Piazza on the floor and walked him to another room but Piazza fell down three steps, and the brother stepped over him on the floor and left him there.\n\nRead More","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T01:57:00.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IJSZI7lzhBX9OYpuy3MN0A--/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.go.com/ap-piazza-er-1705055_16x9_992.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"C7GYAeDyQAKHpHW0vGUqsg==\n"}

None of the officers were injured.\n\nThat's when police discovered Dr. Lina Bolanos and her fiance Dr. Richard Field, who were pronounced dead at the scene from \"traumatic injuries.\"\n\nField, 49, and Bolanos, 38, were both anesthesiologists.\n\nThe suspect was identified as 30-year-old Bampumim Teixeira, who was recently released from prison after serving less than a year on a larceny conviction, Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley, told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nDr. Lina Bolanos (R), Dr. Richard Field (L) NBC News\n\nThe doctors were found with their throats cut in their 11th floor penthouse apartment, two officials with knowledge of the investigation told the Boston Globe.\n\nThe victims were bound by their hands and there was blood on the walls of the apartment, the officials told the Globe — with one official saying the suspect had written a \"message of retribution\" on a wall.\n\nField sent one last text message to a friend, pleading for help, before he was killed, the officials told the newspaper.\n\n\"It's very troubling,\" Boston Police Commissioner William Evans told the Boston Globe on Saturday. \"These are two well-respected people killed in their penthouse apartment.\"\n\nBoston police declined to comment on Sunday about the details of the bloody scene, but said the killing \"did not appear to be random.\"\n\nNorth Shore Pain Management, where Field worked as a doctor, released a statement saying he was known for his \"tireless devotion.\"\n\nRelated: Double-Homicide Victims ID'd as Boston-Area Doctors\n\n\"Dr. Field was a guiding vision at North Shore Pain Management and was instrumental in the creation of this practice, in 2010,\" the company said in the statement, later adding that he \"was noted for his tireless devotion to his patients, staff and colleagues.\"\n\nPrior to working at North Shore Pain Management, Field was an anesthesiologist and pain management specialist at Beverly Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Massachusetts.\n\nBolanos, who worked at Massachusetts Eye and Ear hospital, was described as \"an outstanding pediatric anesthesiologist.\n\n\"The entire Mass.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has characterized such \"nation-state\" legislation as putting \"obstacles in the way of peace\".\n\nIn meetings in Israel, Trump will discuss how he plans to broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians, a goal that has evaded many previous administrations. He is also scheduled to meet Abbas during the trip.\n\nCritics have described the proposed legislation, which also declares that the \"right to self determination\" in Israel is \"unique to the Jewish people\" as impinging on the rights of its Arab minority, who make up some 20 percent of the population.\n\nOpponents said that the bill designates only Hebrew as the country's official language, although it requires government services and forms to be available in Arabic as well.\"The nation-state law is tyranny by the majority and 'legally' turns us into second-class citizens,\" Arab legislator Ayman Odeh wrote on Twitter after the cabinet committee's decision.\n\nDichter, however, called the move \"an important step in entrenching our identity, not only in consciousness of the world but primarily in our own minds\".\n\nThe revised legislation appeared to soften previous language that would have given Jewish values prominence in law-making and judicial decisions.\n\nCentrists in Netanyahu's government have argued a \"nation-state\" bill is unnecessary, noting the 1948 Declaration of Independence already proclaimed a Jewish state. They have accused him of pandering to right-wingers, and past versions of the legislation failed to make it through parliament.\n\n(Additional reporting by Maayan Lubell; Editing by Angus MacSwan)","author":"Jeffrey Heller","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T13:59:20.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20170507\u0026t=2\u0026i=1183578603\u0026w=\u0026fh=545px\u0026fw=\u0026ll=\u0026pl=\u0026sq=\u0026r=LYNXMPED460KN","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"BesPH32QjJqSFLjWj+H24A==\n"}

Cutting nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid will give states the freedom to tailor the program to suit their needs, Price said Sunday, May 7, as he defended a narrowly passed House bill that aims to undo parts of the health care law enacted by the previous administration. (Evan Vucci, File/Associated Press)\n\nBRANCHBURG, N.J. — President Donald Trump urged Senate Republicans on Sunday to “not let the American people down,” as the contentious debate over overhauling the U.S. health care systems shifts to Congress’ upper chamber, where a vote is potentially weeks, if not months, away.\n\nSome senators have already voiced displeasure with the health care bill that cleared the House last week, with Republicans providing all the “yes” votes in the 217-213 count. They cited concerns about potential higher costs for older people and those with pre-existing conditions, along with cuts to Medicaid.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican whose vote will be critical to getting a bill to Trump’s desk and who voiced similar concerns, said the Senate would not take up the House bill.\n\n“The Senate is starting from scratch. We’re going to draft our bill, and I’m convinced we will take the time to do it right,” she said.\n\nMick Mulvaney, Trump’s budget director, also said the version that gets to the president will likely differ from the House measure. Such a scenario would then force the House and Senate to work together to forge a compromise bill that both houses can support.\n\nCollins also complained that the House rushed a vote before the Congressional Budget Office could complete its cost-benefit analysis.\n\nEager to check off a top campaign promise, Trump sought Sunday to pressure Senate Republicans on the issue.\n\n“Republican senators will not let the American people down!” Trump tweeted from his private golf course in central New Jersey, where he has stayed since late Thursday. “ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up — it was a lie and it is dead!”\n\nTrump has said the current system is failing as insurers pull out of markets, forcing costs and deductibles to rise.\n\nThe White House on Sunday scoffed at Democratic claims that voters will punish the GOP in the 2018 elections for upending former President Barack Obama’s law. “I think that the Republican Party will be rewarded,” said Reince Priebus, Trump’s chief of staff. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California has threatened that GOP lawmakers will “glow in the dark” over their vote.\n\nThe House bill would end the health care law’s fines on people who don’t buy policies and erase its taxes on health industry businesses and higher earners. It would dilute consumer-friendly insurance coverage requirements, like prohibiting higher premiums for customers with pre-existing medical conditions and watering down the subsidies that help consumers afford health insurance.\n\nMajor medical and other groups, including the American Medical Association, opposed the House bill. Democrats are also refusing to participate in any effort to dismantle Obama’s law, while some Republican senators — Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — object to cutting Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor and disabled.\n\nThe ACA expanded Medicaid with extra payments to 31 states to cover more people. The House bill halts the expansion, in addition to cutting federal spending on the program, which Trump’s health chief argued is flawed and dictates too much from Washington.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price argued that states will get more freedom to experiment with the program and make sure that people who rely on Medicaid get the care and coverage they need.\n\n“There are no cuts to the Medicaid program,” Price insisted Sunday, adding that resources are being doled out to allow states greater flexibility.\n\nGov. John Kasich of Ohio questioned what would happen to the mentally ill, drug addicts and people with chronic illnesses under the changes proposed for Medicaid.\n\n“They are going to be living in the emergency rooms again,” potentially driving up health care costs, Kasich predicted.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., plans to move forward under special procedures that allow legislation to pass with a simple majority vote, instead of the 60 usually required for major bills in the Senate. That means McConnell can afford to lose just two senators; Vice President Mike Pence would vote to break a 50-50 tie in his constitutional role as vice president of the Senate.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., appeared resigned to the legislative reality that the bill he unveiled with great fanfare, after years of Republican pledges to replace what’s become known as “Obamacare,” will be altered as part of a “multistage process.”\n\n“We think we need to do even more support for people who are older and also more support for people with pre-existing conditions,” Ryan acknowledged. “The Senate will complete the job.”\n\nSome House lawmakers have been challenged by the public over the House vote.\n\nConservative Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, drew boos Friday at a public meeting for his response to a constituent who said the House bill tells people on Medicaid to “accept dying.\n\nLabrador responded: “That line is so indefensible. Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care.” The comment traveled quickly on social media.\n\nCollins and Ryan appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” Price was on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and on CNN’s “State of the Union” with Kasich, while Mulvaney was interviewed on CBS’ ”Face the Nation.” Priebus was on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Hope Yen in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that House vote to pass the health care legislation was 217-213, not 217-214.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Know of one that we don't? Add it below by hitting the EDIT button!\n\nEditUnlimited Materials\n\n\n\nIf you're lacking materials to fabricate extra weapons, ammo, and medkits - there is a way to recycle materials into even more materials.\n\nTo do this, interact with any Recycler and transfer a single material stack to the recycler. Now switch inventories so you are managing the Recycler inventory, and split the stack into 9 smaller stacks. Now, if you look at the Recycler activation button, it will show that you'll gain more materials than you put in - due to splitting the stacks after putting the stack in the Recycler.\n\nThis works exponentially: the more of a material you put in before splitting it into 9 stacks, the more you'll gain as a result. This only works for duplicating one material at a time, but you can use it to fabricate as many items as you want (if you have the fabrication plans).\n\n\n\n\n\nEditUse Physics Instead of the Leverage Skill\n\n\n\nIt might be tempting to spend your Neuromods on the Leverage Skill to be able to pick up heavy objects - especially when there are lots of barricades hiding good loot.\n\nHowever, you can break down almost any barricade with the simple (and glitchy) application of physics. Find a large objects you can carry (chairs work nicely) and while carrying it, try and wedge it into the side of a barricade. When picked up, the item become transparent, but still has a bit of weight to it when pushed against heavy objects. If you can place it in a way that causes it to clip through the environment, it will try to right itself by expanding and pushing other objects aside - even if they normally require Leverage to move.\n\nIt may take a bit of trial an error, but as long as you are persistent you should be able to open up enough holes to slip through almost any barricade of heavy objects, and save your Neuromods for other skills.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T18:56:33.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/05/27/contentplaceholderpng-967b4c.png","class":"Sports","digest":"Rf2m8Uvh5Wc1pz+rO+pDwg==\n"}

Thrawn isn't the only EU idea that's jumped from Legends. Thrawn isn't the only EU idea that's jumped from Legends.\n\nBefore April 2014, the Star Wars universe had levels of canon. The films and Star Wars: The Clone Wars were on their own level, while comics, games, and books had different classifications. The latter stories were collected under the Expanded Universe (or EU) umbrella. Things have since become simpler. Since April 2014, the Expanded Universe published up to that point became Legends, or non-canon. New novels, comics, and other complementary material is now canon, however, and part of the current storytelling universe.\n\nIf a story is classified as canon, it has to fit within established parameters/stories and can affect or be affected by other canon material. It's that simple. Legends material isn't any less enjoyable or any less valid because it's not canon.\n\nAhem. With that important note out of the way, I recognize it's exciting to see familiar characters, ships, and locations transfer from Legends to canon. It means seeing more of a concept you love -- maybe even a concept responsible for influencing your Star Wars fandom. Grand Admiral Thrawn certainly made an impact on many fans, and eventually jumped from the EU to the Rebels animated series. Thrawn's maybe the biggest name to transfer to canon, but he's far from the only example to cross the divide since 2014. Here are 13 notable EU concepts that have shown up in the current canon storytelling universe... And May the 4th be with you!\n\nGrand Admiral Thrawn\n\nGrand Admiral Thrawn, a.k.a. Mitth'raw'nuruodo, was introduced in the 1991 Expanded Universe book Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn. The Chiss made an impression and appeared in a number of Expanded Universe stories. He entered canon in 2016 with Season 3 of Star Wars Rebels. As a primary villain pitted against the Ghost crew and the budding Rebel Alliance, Thrawn has been a formidable threat. Zahn also penned a recently released canonical book about the character, titled Thrawn.\n\nRukh\n\nAnother character from Heir to the Empire is coming to the canon family with Rukh. In Legends, he was a personal bodyguard of and assassin for Thrawn. The Noghri warrior also served as a Noghri Death Commando for Emperor Palpatine. It's quite the resume. And now, he's joining Star Wars Rebels. The announcement came at Star Wars Celebration Orlando as Rukh appeared briefly in the Season 4 trailer; he'll be voiced by Star Wars veteran Warwick Davis.\n\nArmand Isard\n\nIsard is a familiar surname to fans of the Expanded Universe, mostly because of Ysanne Isard. But her father Armand showed up in a number of comics and a couple of novels. First mentioned in 1996's X-Wing: Rogue Squadron by Michael A. Stackpole, Armand rose through the ranks to become the Director of Imperial Intelligence for the Empire. He was brought back in the 2014 novel Tarkin by James Luceno; in this iteration, Armand is the Director of the Commission for the Preservation of the New Order.\n\nRX-24\n\nDid you go on Star Tours at Disney Parks before it changed to Star Tours: The Adventures Continue? Then you know RX-24, a.k.a. Captain Rex. The pilot droid led the StarSpeeder spacecraft on a series of adventures in the attraction, and he ended up transporting members of the Ghost crew in Star Wars Rebels. RX-24 appeared in the Season 1 episode \"Droids in Distress\" as a pilot for the Star Commuter 2000. He was voiced by Paul Reubens for the ride and for the animated series.\n\nLumpy and Malla\n\nThe recent Aftermath: Empire's End by Chuck Wendig kind of brought a character from the notorious Star Wars Holiday Special to canon. In the special, Chewbacca had a son who went by Lumpy, short for Lumpawarrump. In Empire's End, Chewie and his wife Malla (also from the Holiday Special) had a kid named Lumpawaroo. Close enough to count, right?\n\nMalachor\n\nIn the Season 2 finale of Star Wars Rebels, Ahsoka, Kanan, and Ezra went to Malachor, a planet that was home to a Sith temple. The location got its start in Legends, specifically in the game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The planet was technically mentioned once in The Clone Wars, but it played a significant role in the story in Rebels.\n\nTIE Defenders\n\nThe Imperial Factory on Lothal churned out a new kind of Imperial ship in Star Wars Rebels: the TIE/D Defender. The ship's features included a hyperdrive and deflector shields and was made as a result of an initiative headed by Thrawn. The Empire revealed their new ship in \"Secret Cargo,\" but this spaceship's beginnings were in the 1994 game Star Wars: TIE Fighter.\n\nNar Shaddaa\n\nIn the Dark Horse Comic Dark Empire, writer Tom Veitch and artist Cam Kennedy brought Nar Shaddaa into the picture. The largest moon of Nal Hutta went by many names, including Smuggler's Moon. It was a shady sort of place and important location in Hutt Space and it became part of canon with the mobile game Star Wars: Commander before going on to play an important role in the ongoing Star Wars comic in the \"Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon\" arc.\n\nInterdictors\n\nLet's touch on another interesting vehicle that came to canon in Star Wars Rebels: the Imperial Interdictor. Appearing as a prototype in Season 2's \"Stealth Strike,\" the ship was special because of its gravity wells. They could stop other ships from jumping into hyperspace. The kernel of the Interdictor idea started in Heir to the Empire; then it was called an Immobilizer 418 cruiser, an Interdictor-class ship. It was sometimes referred to as the Dreadnaught or the Interdictor. That ship's gravity well projectors were used to pull others from hyperspace or to stop them from escaping into it.\n\nImperial Security Bureau\n\nSince Wullf Yularen was in A New Hope, the Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) technically appeared in the film because he was part of the group. But, the notion of the law enforcement and intelligence agency was developed in West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. We've got to know the group more in Star Wars Rebels through Agent Kallus; he was one of the ISB's elite and known for getting the job done. The Aftermath books' Sinjir Rath Velus was also a member of the group.\n\nRepublic Outland Regions Security Force\n\nRogue Planet, a novel from 2000 by Greg Bear, introduced the Republic Outland Regions Security Force. Simply put, the military organization worked from Eriadu to bring order to the Outer Rim. Oh, and it was started by Wilhuff Tarkin's cousin, Ranulph Tarkin. The force became canon as Outland Regions Security Force in the novel Tarkin; they operated on Eriadu and strove to protect the Seswenna sector.\n\nInquisitorius\n\nThe members of the Empire's Inquisitorius have caused a number of problems for the Ghost crew in Star Wars Rebels, who've faced the Grand Inquisitor and the Seventh Sister among others. The group is tasked with hunting and eliminating any surviving Jedi. This organization was in place in 1996's Young Jedi Knights: The Rise of the Shadow Academy by Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta. They also appeared repeatedly in The Last Jedi books. The Legends Inquisitorius was staffed with dark side Force-sensitive agents and they had a similar goal as the Inquisitors in canon.\n\nShantipole\n\nIn Season 2 of Star Wars Rebels, Hera got to take the B-wing prototype for a test flight on Shantipole. The planet with the violent atmosphere isn't new to players of West End Games' Star Wars Roleplaying Game. The game featured Research Station Shantipole, an asteroid that was home to the development of the B-wing starfighter.\n\nWhat other EU elements would you like to see made canon?

On May 7th they elected Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old former Socialist economy minister who has never fought an election campaign in his life, to be their next president. According to early estimates, the one-time investment banker secured a resounding 65.5% of the vote in the final run-off against his opponent, the nationalist Marine Le Pen. It was an emphatic demonstration that it is possible in a Western liberal democracy to fashion a pro-European, centrist response to populism and nationalism.\n\nThis was a historic result on many counts. Mr Macron will become the youngest-ever French president, beating the previous record held by Napoléon Bonaparte’s nephew, Louis-Napoléon, elected in 1848 at the age of 40. In a country that likes presidential candidates to have serial battle scars, Mr Macron has never been a deputy, nor stood for election. He set up his political movement, En Marche! (On the Move!), only 13 months ago. His hopes of building it up against existing party machines, with their deep pockets and decades of experience, looked then like a far-fetched fantasy. Since the Fifth Republic was established by Charles de Gaulle in 1958, no independent candidate without electoral experience has come anywhere close to the French presidency.\n\nYet Mr Macron tapped into a mood of disillusion, thanks to a combination of fearsome self-belief, a canny reading of the political forces in France, and a good dose of luck. At almost every nationwide election for the past ten years, at all levels of government, the French have voted against the party in power. After five years under a Socialist president, François Hollande, the centre-right Republicans thought that this year’s election belonged to them. But their candidate, François Fillon, was damaged by a parliamentary-payroll scandal. He was only one of many old-timers to be swept aside during this campaign, among them Nicolas Sarkozy (a former president), Alain Juppé and Manuel Valls (two former prime ministers). The young independent candidate had gambled early that a space might open up in the liberal centre; his intuition served him well. Even a massive hacking of his team’s computers on the night of May 5th, which security experts suspected was Russian-orchestrated, was not enough to wreck the vote.\n\nMr Macron’s extraordinary political adventure began with the observation that existing French parties were not only failing to respond to the fear fuelling populism. The old party division between left and right, he judged, was also hampering a proper effort to fashion a political bulwark against the rise of populist nationalism, as well as blocking consensus around economic reform. From a family of doctors in the provincial northern town of Amiens, the young Mr Macron was a student at the elite Ecole Nationale d’Administration in 2002, when Ms Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, took the far-right National Front (FN) into the second-round run-off (he lost to the Gaullist Jacques Chirac). He traces his thinking about the failure of party politics to that moment.\n\nThe French political class, he wrote in his book, “Révolution”, has been “sleepwalking” ever since. Instead of trying to combat the FN’s ideas, Mr Macron concluded, parties focused on trying to shut them out of power. “As long as traditional parties brandish only fear or morality to fight the FN, it won’t be efficient,” he told The Economist last year. Politicians, he argued, needed to propose something positive, persuasive and engaging instead: an open, tolerant, pro-European society, based on encouraging private enterprise rather than crushing or over-protecting it, and creating paths out of poverty for globalisation’s victims.\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr Macron hammered this point home. At one tense point, the candidate took his argument that borders could not be shut, nor redundancies outlawed, into a hostile, FN-supporting group of unionists on the picket line at a factory in his home town . At rallies, he managed the improbable exploit of getting cheering crowds to wave European Union flags. During an explosive televised debate that exposed the FN candidate’s weakness, Ms Le Pen accused Mr Macron of being the candidate of “savage globalisation”; he retorted that she was the “high priestess of fear”.\n\nOnce the victory celebrations on election night subside, Mr Macron will need to find a way to speak to the one-third who rejected him. Many of these angry voters are from small towns and rural parts that have lost jobs, factories and services, and see no benign side to globalisation. Some backed Mr Macron only to keep out Ms Le Pen. Others abstained or left their ballots blank, dismayed by the choice between what some called “cholera or the plague”: global finance or xenophobic nationalism. Ms Le Pen may de disappointed with her result, but she still set an FN record, nearly doubling the score her father achieved. Her party, and populism, will continue to weigh on French politics. Her party, and populism, will continue to weigh on French politics.\n\nIn the coming days, Mr Macron will begin to take in the full measure of what he has achieved, but also of the burden of the task ahead. He will appoint a provisional government but then needs to secure, or stitch together, a governing majority in parliament after two-round elections in June. However constitutionally powerful the French president, he cannot enact reforms without the political backing of parliament. En Marche! currently has no sitting deputies elected under its banner, and will be fielding scores of newcomers to politics. Mr Macron’s victory may well presage a realignment of French politics. But the Republicans in particular, feeling robbed of their turn, are bracing for a fight.\n\nMr Macron inherits not only a divided country, but the heavy weight of expectations. Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy and France’s longstanding ally within Europe, has notably vested great hopes in the incoming president’s determination to break with his predecessors’ habits of ignoring campaign promises to reform France. Mr Macron’s ability to revive confidence and turn France around matters for the whole of Europe. If he fails, it will be harder than ever next time to keep populism at bay, and the FN out of power.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2017/05/articles/main/20170513_blp901.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"JdTEAZEsY48+Mjp9998HHg==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"590f70e1522ffcfb9a9ac5da"},"description":"The French presidential favourite was shaped by Amiens, the place he outgrew","title":"What Emmanuel Macron’s home town says about him","url":"http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21721637-french-presidential-favourite-was-shaped-amiens-place-he-outgrew-what-emmanuel-macrons","text":"WHEN history recounts the remarkable rise of Emmanuel Macron, it might start and end in the town of Amiens. On the big-skied plains of the Somme, amid the woods and the fields of yellow rape that cover former bloody battlefields, this redbrick working-class city is the French presidential candidate’s hometown. With its soaring 13th-century cathedral, and charmless rebuilt central drag, Amiens is arresting both for its splendour and its banality. It is the place that shaped Mr Macron, and the town he fled. It was also the setting for a fraught encounter in the campaign’s closing days, which revealed much about the man who could soon be the next, and youngest-ever, president of France.\n\nIt was as a pupil at a private Jesuit school in Amiens, aptly named Providence, that Mr Macron met the drama teacher, Brigitte Auzière, fully 24 years his senior, who later became his wife. The bond alarmed his parents, both provincial doctors, who sent him to finish his schooling in Paris instead. The bookish student was at first in awe at the brilliance of the capital’s brightest. But he quickly learned the codes of the French elite, winning a place at the Ecole Nationale d’Administration—whose alumni include three of the five past presidents—and with it access to the power-brokers in Paris.\n\nIf Mr Macron outgrew Amiens, it was through a desire, as he puts it, “to choose my own life”. What underlies his single-mindedness is a “quest for liberty”, says Marc Ferracci, his best man and an economist on his team. Mr Macron defied convention with his marriage. He later sought financial independence by working as an investment banker at Rothschild. As economy minister under the Socialist president, François Hollande, he was an outspoken critic of the 35-hour working week. Just a year ago, Mr Macron flouted rules by launching his own political movement, En Marche! (“On the Move!”), as a rival to both the Socialist Party he once belonged to, and the president he served. The gamble was immense; so was the freedom it secured him.\n\nWhen the French select their president on May 7th, Amiens is set to back its most famous son. In first-round voting he came top there, scoring four points above his national result. Yet the town’s gritty industrial vulnerability also makes it an awkward home turf for the candidate whom Marine Le Pen, his nationalist opponent, pillories as the champion of “savage globalisation”, “arrogant finance” and the rootless elite. Its unemployment rate, at 12%, is above the national average. In recent years Amiens has lost a mattress factory and a tyre plant. Now the Whirlpool factory, where 286 workers make tumble-dryers, is closing too, with production moving to lower-cost Poland. The town’s troubles, in short, put Mr Macron’s pro-European creed of open borders and corporate freedom sorely to the test.\n\nSo it was not until last week that Mr Macron at last made a campaign stop in Amiens. It began dismally. As he sat down with union leaders in a meeting room in the town centre, Ms Le Pen staged an ambush. Turning up unannounced at the Whirlpool factory gate on the outskirts, she claimed to be supporting “the workers” while Mr Macron was defending “the oligarchy”. His team hastily scheduled a campaign stop at the factory that afternoon. It was a brave decision. As plumes of black smoke rose from burning tyres, unionists in fluorescent jackets awaited his arrival in a hostile, muscular block. The acrid stink of charred rubber hung in the air. “We don’t expect anything of Macron, he’s just the continuation of Hollande,” declared Jean Santerre, a worker at the factory for 23 years. He said that he and his colleagues will vote for Ms Le Pen, because she will “shut the borders” and stop foreigners taking French jobs.\n\nSure enough, when the besuited Mr Macron stepped from his car, he was jeered. His security team trailed his black car all the way down the narrow lane leading to the picket line, just in case. Yet for nearly an hour the candidate waded into the edgy crowd, taking on the abuse, arguing his case, and refusing to make empty promises. Non , he said, he could not outlaw factory closures. Non , shutting the border would not help France in the long run. Retraining would be improved; buy-out options would be examined. By the time Mr Macron drove off, Mr Santerre and his friends had not changed their minds. But calm had returned, and with it a certain respect for his efforts.\n\nNo fear\n\nThe Amiens moment may not shift votes. It was Ms Le Pen’s selfies with smiling workers that grabbed the headlines. Yet it offered a telling insight. Although 60% say they will vote for Mr Macron, only 37% think he has presidential stature. He has often appeared more ambiguous than decisive, more charming than tough. Even in France, which treats public intellectuals like national treasures, his erudite vocabulary and measured reasoning are mocked. At rallies, he drowns his audience with abstract nouns; when he finally told an anecdote on stage in Paris this week, it was about a philosopher. Perhaps the only thing that his detractors and admirers agree on is that Mr Macron is “ dans la séduction ”. Dinner guests and factory workers alike are left with the impression that he has listened, and valued the argument.\n\nIf there are reservations about Mr Macron’s ability to lead, they concern his untested political resolve. Faced with a fractured country, restless unions and a potentially unstable parliament after legislative elections in June, would he have what it takes to stave off, or withstand, revolt? “He is fearless,” says a team member, pointing to the way that he, a newcomer to elections, has swept aside political veterans and is now dictating terms to them. In 2012 Mr Hollande also visited a factory, a steelworks, during his campaign. He vowed to rescue it, failed while in office, and political disillusion ensued. Mr Macron’s gutsier approach in Amiens may not be what wins him the presidency. But it suggests how he might exercise it.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-06T00:00:00.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20170506_EUD000_0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"zvUvu18xKXVjgmufo6w9rQ==\n"}

Mr Choi’s gourmet food truck has since inspired a reality-TV programme and a hit Hollywood film , and helped jumpstart a $1.2bn industry.\n\nAmerica now boasts over 4,000 food trucks. According to IBISWorld, a market research firm, from 2011 to 2016 industry revenue grew at an annual rate of 7.9%. But a patchwork of state and local regulations means that the trendy trucks are more popular in some places than others. Portland, Oregon, a city known for its vibrant culinary scene, has had small food carts on its streets for decades. After a study in 2008 by researchers at Portland State University concluded that the carts benefited residents, the city began encouraging the use of vacant land for food-truck clusters or “pods”. Today, Food Carts Portland, a website, reckons the city has over 500 carts and trucks.\n\nIn Chicago, where frigid weather discourages street sales for several months of the year, the relationship between local government and food truck owners is much chillier. The Windy City prohibits food trucks from setting up shop within 200 feet of a bricks-and-mortar restaurant or from parking in any one location for more than two hours. Vendors are required to carry GPS devices that record their whereabouts every five minutes. Such restrictions have stifled the industry’s growth. Despite being home to more than 7,000 restaurants and 144 craft breweries, Chicago has just 70 licensed food trucks.\n\nRestaurateurs complain that food trucks threaten their business. The evidence suggests otherwise. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, counties that have experienced higher growth in mobile-food services have also had quicker growth in their restaurant and catering businesses. Since 2010, the number of restaurants in Seattle and surrounding King County has grown by 16% in spite of a thriving food-truck scene. In Travis County, Texas, which includes Austin, the restaurant count has jumped 18% even as food trucks have increased more than six-fold. Economic theory would not predict such a complementary relationship between competing industries. Perhaps there is such a thing as a free lunch after all.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-04T15:28:12.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20170506_WOC613.png","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"j7AYbeMaVQpSnktp/Xo4sg==\n"}

Bowser stood before a packed house at the city’s historic Lincoln Theatre and called on taxpayers to make an unprecedented investment in the poor.\n\nFor the first time, she announced, the District would devote $100 million in city funds each year to the Housing Production Trust Fund — a lifeline for families struggling to find a place to live in one of the least affordable cities in the country. “If we’re going to be a city where families can stay and grow, we must do more to create opportunity for them,” Bowser (D) said during her State of the District address in March 2015.\n\nBut at the city agency entrusted with producing homes for the poor, officials were giving up millions of additional dollars from another essential source of affordable housing money: the federal government.\n\nThe D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development was forced to forfeit $15.8 million in the past three years after repeatedly missing key spending deadlines meant to ensure that federal housing money is properly managed at the local level, The Washington Post found.\n\nThe spending problems predate the Bowser administration, but most of the bills came due soon after the mayor took office and launched her affordable housing plans.\n\nNo other housing agency in the country returned more ­affordable-housing money to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development between 2014 and 2016 than the District’s — which forfeited 22 percent of all the money that was sent back to HUD in the three-year period, an analysis of federal data shows.\n\nThe $15.8 million sent back could have provided rent vouchers for a year to roughly 1,000 of the city’s poorest families.\n\n“This is insane,” said Will Merrifield, a lawyer at the nonprofit Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless. “That they would allow this money to go to waste is absurd.”\n\nThe funding came from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which for 25 years has provided seed money to developers willing to build or renovate low-income housing. HUD, which oversees the program, estimates that $1 in HOME funds can leverage $4.28 from other funding sources.\n\nHOME money can also be used to provide down-payment assistance to buyers or to fund vouchers for families that cannot afford rent on the private market. The program — the largest federal block grant for affordable housing — has produced 1.2 million affordable units across the country in the past quarter-century.\n\nThe District’s housing department was forced to return millions in HOME dollars even as the homeless population soared, more and more families moved into shelters, and the waiting list for rent vouchers remained closed to new households. Nearly 40,000 families are waiting for vouchers — those near the top of the list signed up well over a decade ago.\n\n“My kids say: ‘Mommy, what’s wrong? Are we going to be homeless?’ ” said 31-year-old Carolyn Harrison, who took three buses to a $10.75-an-hour cashier’s job in Maryland before losing the position. Though her husband works nights in a residential facility for veterans, the couple can afford only a $300-a-month unit subsidized by a homelessness-prevention nonprofit group.\n\nNow, the lease is up, and Harrison doesn’t know where she and her husband will go with their three young children. She has been waiting for a voucher for nearly 10 years.\n\n“I’m not looking for anyone to do it for me,” she said. “I’m just looking for guidance and assistance to get my life back on track for my kids.”\n\n\n\nCarolyn Harrison, 31, with children Makhi Harrison, 2, Madison Banks, 9, and Malik Harrison, 4.

(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nCity officials acknowledged the loss of HOME money and said they have taken steps since Bowser became mayor two years ago to strengthen the operations of the housing department.\n\n“We knew that we inherited something that wasn’t functional in the way that it needed to be, and the team has been very good at turning that ship around,” said Andrew Trueblood, chief of staff to the deputy mayor for planning and economic development.\n\nThe housing agency’s director, Polly Donaldson, said that when she took over in 2015 the department had 40 vacancies, management issues and a shortage of housing developers willing to take on HOME-funded projects. Top staffers met weekly to discuss HOME deadlines, find ways to recruit nonprofit developers and communicate with HUD, she said.\n\nSending money back to HUD, Donaldson said, “really incentivized and mobilized us even more to get this system fixed.”\n\n“Federal funds continue to be a very important source of funding for us in the District,” she said. “We must use these funds, and that is my mandate.”\n\nDespite the loss of federal funds, Donaldson said, the housing department in the past year allocated $20 million in new federal dollars, including money from the HOME program, and $106 million in local dollars from the Housing Production Trust Fund.\n\nAll told, the District has spent $600 million of its own money since 2001 on housing, producing more than 9,500 units, according to the city.\n\nBut the housing department’s management of that money has drawn sharp criticism.\n\nD.C. law requires the housing department to spend 40 percent of trust-fund dollars on “extremely low-income” families — those earning no more than $32,580 for a household of four — and another 40 percent on “very low income” households — those earning up to $54,300.\n\nCity auditors reported in March that the department has spent far less: In 2014, only 32 percent of the trust-fund dollars were allocated to those two groups. In 2015, it was 49 percent.\n\n“The majority of that money does not go to the people most in need,” said Amber Harding, a lawyer with the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless.\n\nAuditors also found that the housing department over the years did not verify the income levels of residents who did receive housing. And although the city has reported that thousands of homes have been built or renovated with trust-fund dollars since 2001, auditors found the department’s records too “unreliable” to know for sure.\n\nAuditors are now trying to build a database that tracks the trust fund’s spending and production levels.\n\n“Information (i.e. number of units, number of projects, and award amounts) from DHCD was constantly changing,” auditors wrote.\n\nThe housing department is supposed to commission an annual independent audit of the fund, but no audit has been done, the District’s auditors found.\n\n“We were told . . . that they lack resources to oversee many aspects of the [Housing Production Trust Fund] program because they must devote resources to the federally-funded housing programs . . . and they do not want to risk the loss of federal funds,” auditors wrote.\n\nBut the housing department ended up losing federal money anyway.\n\n\n\nCarolyn Harrison sits with her husband, Samson, who holds their son Makhi, at a financial literacy workshop hosted by the D.C. arm of the nonprofit organization Operation Hope as part of a homelessness prevention program. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nHurting the most vulnerable\n\nHousing groups said the HOME money could have been used to renovate blighted, dangerous rental apartments — in the District, 2,000 households live in units without kitchens or plumbing.\n\nIn Fairfax County, Va., and Montgomery County, Md., housing officials have used some HOME money to give out rent vouchers to cash-strapped families. Neither county has returned money to HUD in the past three years.\n\n“The HOME program is critical to the work we do,” said Shauna Sorrells, a former HUD administrator who is the director of legislative and public affairs at Montgomery’s nonprofit Housing Opportunities Commission, which has used HOME funds to pay for vouchers. “We don’t leave any money on the table.”\n\nIn the District, the housing department considered plans similar to those in Fairfax and Montgomery. In a 2014 department memo obtained by The Post, administrators acknowledged that HOME money could be used to fund rent vouchers.\n\nTo do so, the department would have to modify its policies and a consolidated housing plan it submits to HUD every five years. The money would then be turned over to the D.C. Housing Authority, a separate agency that oversees the city’s stock of 8,400 public housing units.\n\nThe Housing Authority manages the city’s waiting list for public housing units and the city’s more than 11,000 rent vouchers. At current funding levels, only about 100 vouchers become available each year for new families. Although families’ needs can differ, an average voucher covers about $1,250 a month in rent, according to housing officials.\n\n“The Housing Authority had a vehicle in place,” said lawyer Michelle Christopher, a former compliance manager at the housing department who is a staff attorney at a health-care agency in Louisiana. “We didn’t have to do anything but give that money over to them. We would have helped people.”\n\nNathan Simms, former deputy director of the housing department, said officials in 2014 were poised to transfer $3 million in HOME funds and had proposed an amendment to the city’s consolidated plan.\n\nBut the plan was set aside in 2015 when Bowser became mayor and Donaldson took over the housing department, he said.\n\n“We were moving in that direction, and then the administration changed, and that was something they didn’t want to move forward with,” said Simms, a former U.S. HUD official who worked at the housing department from 2011 to 2015. “They had different thoughts. They wanted to put it into projects.”\n\nDonaldson said the housing department has since listed rent vouchers as an eligible use of HOME funds in the city’s newest consolidated plan, which has been approved by HUD. But there are no plans to spend the money on vouchers this year, because other projects are more pressing, officials said.\n\n“I can only say that, going forward and looking forward, we are making that possible, and we are, again, increasing options as best we can,” Donaldson said.\n\nHousing advocates said the delays and struggles at the department over the years have hurt the city’s most vulnerable residents.\n\nMichael Wilkerson, a 55-year-old former security officer disabled by cervical degeneration, has been waiting seven years for a voucher.\n\nHe pays $300 a month to rent a basement room in Northeast Washington with a crumbling floor of dirt and concrete, no running water, and cracks in the ceiling that allow urine from the dogs upstairs to drip into his room. With no gas to warm the place, the winters are frigid.\n\nWilkerson is desperate to move out, but so far, he has not received a rent voucher, and his only income is $1,415 a month in disability payments from Social Security.\n\n“I’m not asking for anything more than I need,” said Wilkerson, who washes with $1 jugs of water from Dollar Tree. “Just a comfortable place to lay my head.”\n\n\n\nMichael Wilkerson rides a Metro bus for his daily dinner at Miriam’s Kitchen, a charitable organization in Northwest Washington.

His only income is $1,415 a month in Social Security disability payments. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nLosing unspent money\n\nHUD allocates about $950 million a year in HOME funding, but it is up to hundreds of local housing agencies to decide how to spend their share of the money.\n\nIn exchange, housing agencies must meet two major deadlines: HOME funds must be placed under contract for a project within two years and be spent within five. In 2015, the rule changed, eliminating the five-year deadline and requiring that all projects be completed within four years.\n\nPresident Trump’s 2018 budget proposal calls for eliminating the HOME program — part of $6 billion in potential cuts at the embattled federal agency. Housing advocates in the District and across the country said the loss of that money would devastate communities that for years have successfully leveraged HOME funds.\n\nNationwide, 72 percent of about 640 housing agencies did not have to return any money to HUD from 2014 to 2016 — spending a total of $2.9 billion, The Post’s analysis found. All told, about $72 million went unspent.\n\nThe bulk of that money — $43 million — was concentrated at 16 housing agencies that each returned $1 million or more, including those in New Orleans, Seattle and Colorado Springs. Prince George’s County, Md., returned $1 million.\n\nHUD officials provided historical and financial data but declined to comment about the returned money.\n\nIn Newark, which sent back $4.4 million because of missed deadlines in prior years, blighted houses with broken windows and crumbling front porches languish in the shadows of the nearly ­century-old Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart. About 20,000 people in the city are on a waiting list for affordable housing.\n\n“It was really challenging to come into office and see we were about to lose funds, to be honest, so I fought HUD hard not to take that money,” said Baye ­Adofo-Wilson, who became Newark’s deputy mayor for economic and housing development in 2014. “But they have their rules and deadlines to keep. Those funds should have been used and projects should have been started.”\n\nIn the District — which returned three times more than Newark and 22 percent of all the money that was forfeited nationwide in the past three years — spending problems date back years.\n\nIn April 2011, shortly after Vincent C. Gray (D) became mayor, former HUD official John Hall took the helm of the housing department, with a $144 million annual budget and about 140 employees charged with using local and federal money to produce housing and revitalize neighborhoods.\n\nThe department had long been troubled: It had had more than 20 directors in 30 years and had been criticized by the HUD inspector general for improperly spending millions in HOME money on three stalled or substandard development projects.\n\nHall took stock of upcoming construction projects. “What do we have in our pipeline?” he recalled asking the department.\n\nThe answer stunned him: Few new projects were lined up. One of the least-affordable cities in the country was at risk of losing $7 million in HOME funds because of looming spending deadlines.\n\n“Projects weren’t ready,” said Christopher, the department’s compliance manager at the time. “The developers didn’t have all their sources of funding and so you couldn’t even really run numbers to see if there was a feasible, viable project.”\n\nHall eventually readied eight projects just before HUD’s spending deadline that October, and then held orientations for developers to encourage new construction.\n\nThe loss of money, Hall said, “would have been catastrophic to the community.”\n\n“My objective was to use every available resource to pour into the community that needed the help and the uplift,” he said. “I looked at it as a blessing that we had all these resources . . . that I could leverage.”\n\nIn June 2012, Gray moved Hall to the deputy mayor’s office and appointed housing veteran Michael Kelly to head the department.\n\nKelly promoted former HUD official Simms to deputy director. Simms said he found that HOME money from years earlier had been promised to developers who had not yet acquired land or to projects that were going to miss HUD’s deadlines. So the department had to cancel the projects, he said.\n\nIn November 2013, HUD wrote to the District, records obtained by The Post show, warning of a nearly $12 million loss in HOME money if the deadlines were not met.\n\nSimms said the housing department continued to make changes, engaging developers and lenders and overhauling underwriting practices.\n\nIn 2014, the housing department returned $400,000 in HOME funds to HUD.\n\n“We were getting a lot of languishing projects out the door,” said Simms, who worked as a debt restructuring specialist at HUD before taking the job at the housing department. “There was just a lot of coordination all the way around.”\n\nBut the deadlines were still coming due.\n\n\n\nCarolyn and Samson Harrison take a quick break after errands, house hunting and a financial literacy class as their children entertain themselves. Carolyn Harrison is among 40,000 rent-voucher applicants on a D.C. waiting list. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nWaiting for better\n\nIn March 2015, two months after becoming mayor, Bowser appeared at the Lincoln Theatre for her first State of the District address, flanked by the Ballou High School drum line. She pledged to make good on her campaign promise by pumping $100 million into the Housing Production Trust Fund, up from $63 million the year before.\n\nBowser had just appointed housing department director Donaldson, who had built a career working with local nonprofit groups.\n\n“Dr. [Martin Luther] King challenged us to develop ‘a kind of dangerous unselfishness,’ ”­Bowser told the crowd. “We will do that by giving a little more to create and preserve affordable housing, to care for our homeless neighbors.”\n\nThat year, the housing department was forced to return $6.6 million to HUD for missed spending deadlines. In 2016, the housing department returned $8.8 million.\n\nHousing department officials said that spending problems from prior years came to a head just after Donaldson became director but that the agency is moving swiftly to ensure that no more money is returned.\n\n“I feel like we’re in a far better position today than we were a year ago or a year and a half ago, because we have better systems in place,” said Allison Ladd, the department’s deputy director.\n\nAs the housing department works to prevent future losses, 27-year-old Mareesha Branch waits for a better place to live.\n\nTwo years ago, a bullet tore through the living room window of her one-bedroom apartment in Southwest Washington. It traveled through two walls before dropping to the floor a few feet from where her 2-year-old daughter was napping in a room filled with Barbies and unicorns.\n\nBranch lives in the tiny apartment thanks to a program for the formerly homeless run by another city agency, the Department of Human Services, which oversees the city’s homelessness services.\n\nShe’s grateful for the place — she and her daughter once spent nights at a shelter when Branch could no longer afford to rent a basement room on a $9-an-hour cashier’s salary. But she cringes every time she hears gunshots outside or finds the street blocked off with crime-scene tape.\n\nInside the apartment, she has covered white walls that have turned a dull shade of yellow with her daughter’s alphabet drawings, but she is hoping to move someplace else. She can’t sign up for a rent voucher, which would give her more choice about where to live, because the waiting list closed more than three years ago and has yet to reopen.\n\n“I want to let my daughter play outside,” said Branch, who is planning to take a nursing aide course at the University of the District of Columbia. “I want to know that I can go to work and she can go to school, and we can come home and be safe.”\n\nNona Tepper and Jingzhe (Kelly) Wang with Northwestern University’s Medill Justice Project and Alice Crites of The Washington Post contributed to this report.

He had been teaching a class in international finance and management at the same university, known as PUST.\n\nPUST is the only private educational institution in North Korea. It is run by a Korean American professor and funded largely by Christian groups. It began offering classes in English to the North Korean elite in 2010.\n\nPUST has more than 60 foreign faculty members, including from the United States, Canada, Britain and China, according to the university’s website.\n\n“The mission of PUST is to pursue excellence in education, with an international outlook, so that its students are diligent in studies, innovative in research and upright in character, bringing illumination to the Korean people and the world,” it says.\n\nSuki Kim, a Korean American author who taught at the university for six months and wrote a book about it, described the faculty members holding private prayer meetings and Bible study sessions.\n\nAll religion is banned in North Korea, a totalitarian state that requires all its citizens to worship the three generations of the Kim family who have run the country through a personality cult since the end of World War II.\n\nHowever, PUST appears to have been tolerated as long as its Christian activities were conducted behind closed doors and the faculty did not try to proselytize to the North Korean students.\n\nTwo other American citizens also are being held in North Korea: former Virginia resident Kim Dong-chul, who had been living in the Chinese city of Yanji, near the border with North Korea, and working in a special economic zone in the North as head of a trade and hotel services company.\n\nHe is in his early 60s and was born in South Korea but became a U.S. citizen in 1987; he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in April 2016 on charges of spying.\n\nThe other is Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who was detained for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda sign from a Pyongyang hotel on New Year’s Day last year while on a group tour.\n\nWarmbier was convicted of subversion in March and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. That is the last time that he was seen and that Swedish diplomats, who represent the United States in North Korea, were last allowed to meet with him.\n\n\n\nThe State Department advises Americans against traveling to North Korea, warning of “the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea’s system of law enforcement.”\n\nThe detentions come at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea.\n\nPresident Trump has been vacillating between calling Kim Jong Un a “smart cookie” and threatening military action against North Korea, while the Kim regime has been warning of a nuclear attack in the face of any U.S. threat.\n\nIn the latest development, North Korea accused the United States and South Korean intelligence agencies on Friday of plotting to kill Kim Jong Un using “biochemical substances.”\n\n\n\nNorth Korea’s Foreign Ministry called the agencies “hotbed of evils in the world” and said in a statement that they had “hatched a vicious plot to hurt the supreme leadership.”\n\nThe statement said that a citizen, identified only as Kim, had been paid $290,000 for himself and his “terrorist accomplices” as part of the alleged plot. He was supposed to target the “supreme leadership” at a public event or military parade, using “bomb terrorism” that involved “biochemical substances including radioactive substance and nano-poisonous substance,” the statement said.\n\nKim is the most common surname on the Korean Peninsula, used by about half of all Koreans.\n\nRead more:\n\nWorried about North Korea?

They yelled for him to drop the weapon, according to a police statement, but, instead, the 15-year-old stepped forward.\n\nJust before 3:30 a.m. Saturday, someone called 911 asking police to check on a boy standing in front of Torrey Pines High School, near the northwest corner of the city. The caller referred to the teen in the third person and said the 15-year-old didn’t have a gun.\n\nOfficers saw the boy as they arrived in the school’s front parking lot, according to the statement, but the situation escalated as they got out of their cars.\n\nThe teen “pulled a handgun that was concealed in his waistband and pointed it at one of the officers,” the statement said.\n\nBoth officers pulled their guns. They shouted at the boy to drop the gun.\n\nBut he ignored their orders and started walking toward the officers while still pointing the gun.\n\n“Fearing for their safety, both officers fired their weapons at the male, striking him numerous times,” the statement said.\n\nThe officers requested help and began performing CPR on the teen — their frantic efforts conveyed by radio traffic, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. A dispatcher acknowledged that shots were fired and asked whether any of the officers were injured. An officer responded “negative” but told dispatchers that he and the other officer were performing CPR and that paramedics were needed “now.”\n\nBut the teen’s injuries were too severe. He was pronounced dead at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, Calif.\n\nPolice traced the original 911 call and determined that the teen was the one who had summoned officers to the school, apparently enlisting them in his suicide plot. Police recovered his weapon at the scene — and realized it was a BB gun.\n\nSan Diego police have not released the name of the teen because he is a juvenile, according to the police statement. They said he lived in the neighborhood around the school with his parents.

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)\n\nBillionaire investor Warren E. Buffett rebuked Wells Fargo’s handling of widespread illegal sales practices that spanned at least 15 years and included targeting undocumented immigrants to open new bank accounts.\n\nBuffett said the San Francisco banking giant’s executives failed to act immediately after finding out that employees were creating countless fake and fraudulent bank accounts to meet the company’s unrealistic sales goals. Wells Fargo “incentivized the wrong type of behavior,” Buffett said Saturday during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha. The 86-year-old tycoon is Berkshire’s chairman.\n\n“If there’s a major problem, the CEO will get wind of it. At that moment, that’s the key to everything. The CEO has to act,” Buffett said, according to Reuters. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it.”\n\nBerkshire is Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder.\n\nBuffett’s comments come shortly after former Wells Fargo employees revealed that they were forced to resort to unethical and illegal sales tactics to meet daily sales quotes. Last month, a law firm handling a shareholder lawsuit against Wells Fargo obtained sworn statements from former bank managers, personal bankers and tellers who talked about questionable practices they either engaged in or witnessed.\n\n[Wells Fargo targeted undocumented immigrants, stalked street corners, lawsuit claims]\n\nSome involved creating fake bank accounts with fictitious names, calling current and potential clients well after business hours, and opening multiple accounts for customers, including undocumented immigrants, without their authorization, according to court records.\n\nEmployees at Wells Fargo locations at several states scouted the streets, Social Security offices, construction sites and factories to find undocumented immigrants, take them to a local branch and persuade them to sign up for new accounts, court records say. Knowing that they needed a place to cash their checks, Wells Fargo employees urged them to open new accounts while promising to waive check-cashing fees that the immigrants would otherwise have to pay.\n\nThe more people signed up, whether it was for checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards, online banking or overdraft protection, the better. If they signed up for all of the features, even better, the employees said. Each new account was considered a sale, and the more sales employees racked up, the better their future was with the company.\n\nWells Fargo CEO John Stumpf apologized in front of a Senate panel on Sept. 20, 2016. Wells Fargo has faced criticism for its handling of a scandal involving fake accounts set up by Wells Fargo employees. (Reuters)\n\nThe employees said they reported the troubling practices to their superiors, but their concerns fell on deaf ears.\n\nA six-month investigation by Wells Fargo’s board of directors recently found that the bad sales practices stretched as far back as 2002 — and former chairman and chief executive John Stumpf had known about them since.\n\nMark Folk, a spokesman, said in a statement that Wells Fargo agrees with Buffett’s statements and that the company has taken “decisive actions” to “make things right for customers.”\n\n“We continue to make additional improvements in our Retail Bank operations and we have eliminated product sales goals and introduced a new compensation plan focused on customer experience for branch team members,” Ancel Martinez, another Wells Fargo spokesman, said in an earlier statement.\n\nFolk said the company also has created a new Office of Ethics, Oversight and Integrity that now handles internal investigations and complaints.\n\n[Wells Fargo orders two executives to pay back an additional $75 million after sales scandal probe]\n\nThe alarming statements from former employees are the latest in a massive scandal that continues to engulf Wells Fargo.\n\nStumpf resigned last year. Carrie Tolstedt, the executive in charge of Wells Fargo’s community banking division, also had left the company — with more than $120 million in retirement package. More than 5,000 low-level employees have been fired.\n\nIn September, the company was forced to pay $185 million in regulatory penalties after revelations that more than 2 million bank and credit card accounts were opened on behalf of customers without their knowledge. The fraudulent accounts netted more than $2 million in fees charged to customers for services they didn’t sign up for.\n\nIn February, Wells Fargo fired four executives as the company’s board of directors was completing an investigation into fake accounts believed to have been set up by low-level employees to meet sales quotas.\n\nAnd in April, Wells Fargo ordered Stumpf and Tolstedt to pay a total of $75 million after the board’s investigation concluded.\n\nThe practices, which resulted in crumbling employee morale and labor lawsuits, first came to light after a 2013 report by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nRenae Merle contributed to this story.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nWells Fargo fires 4 executives as investigation continues into sham accounts\n\nWells Fargo’s terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad week\n\nWells Fargo: Too big to fail, too arrogant to admit it","author":"Kristine Phillips, Kristine Phillips","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T06:52:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-05-06/Bloomberg/313094681_0-3.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"Cj3c9C/MvYUVcgzwtYcwiw==\n"}

Next, a lavish castle wedding. Then, a lifetime of “happily ever after.”\n\nAccording to the Walt Disney Co., mere mortals can achieve this fairy tale. That is, with their help, and for the right price.\n\nDisney’s Fairy Tale Weddings \u0026 Honeymoons, the company’s wedding branch, may not be able to set you up with Prince Charming or promise wedded bliss, but they can help you design a wedding day fit for a queen — make that a Disney princess — complete with Cinderella’s horse-drawn carriage and a castle backdrop, natch.\n\nSince September 1991, Disney has put on more than 30,000 weddings around the world, including at Disneyland in California, Walt Disney World in Florida, Disney’s Aulani resort in Hawaii, on multiple Disney cruise lines, and in Disney resorts and parks abroad.\n\nIn 2013, Disney held 1,500 weddings on its properties. Last year, that number swelled to more than 4,000, with about 11 ceremonies a day globally. That trend is likely to continue, as Disney rolls out live-action updates of its classic films over the next several years, such as the recent “Beauty and the Beast” update starring Emma Watson.\n\n(Freeform)\n\nIt doesn’t hurt that millennials are lapping up the princess fantasy.\n\n“They’re all about customization and engaging their wedding guests,” says Korri McFann Spolar, director of marketing for Fairy Tale Weddings. “I think this generation really is fit for a destination wedding, you know, multiple days of celebrating, multiple days of gathering with family and friends.”\n\nIt also helps that the park photos make for one-of-a-kind keepsakes — and easily shareable social-media content (#AndTheySelfiedHappilyEverAfter).\n\nFor Nathan Mulder, 30, and Brian Falco, 30, it was always Disney World or bust. Months before a proposal even took place, they had decided to spend what would be “the best day of their lives” at “the happiest place on Earth.”\n\nThe theme park was a natural fit for the Disneyphiles, who met in Daytona Beach, Fla., in 2006 and wed in August 2016. Fans of Disney movies since childhood, Mulder and Falco visited the park frequently over their decade-long courtship and were at one point annual ticket-holders.\n\nFor their ceremony at Disney’s Beach and Yacht Club Resort in Orlando, the couple envisioned something elegant and traditional, minus the gimmicks and characters — save for a few hundred “hidden Mickeys” scattered throughout the venue.\n\n“I think that a huge misconception about Disney weddings is that . . . they are childish, or maybe even cheesy, with characters plastered everywhere,” Mulder says. “We really wanted to have a wedding that was at Disney, not so much a Disney wedding.”\n\nBrian Falco, 30, and Nathan Mulder, 30, on their wedding day at Walt Disney World in August 2016. The theme of their wedding was “best day ever.” (Switzerfilm)\n\nFor the reception, they splurged on some subtle hints of “Disney magic” for their 225 guests, including an appearance by Mickey and Minnie ($1,700) and a customized projection cake, which lit up with scenes from their favorite Disney films (about $3,000).\n\nThe final price tag? More than $100,000. “The entire week [and] weekend was a dream come true,” Mulder says.\n\nBut not every wedding at Disney is as magical. Yasmin Uddin, a 22-year-old YouTube gamer based in Leeds, England, had a much different experience with the House of Mouse for her wedding last month. After toying with the idea of eloping in Vegas, the bride-to-be and her finance, Kyle Sinnett, 26, settled on a small ceremony for 24 guests at Disney’s Wedding Pavilion in Orlando for about $25,000.\n\nFirst, Uddin and Sinnett’s fairy godmother — what Disney calls their wedding coordinators — was sparingly communicative. When Uddin requested a venue visit in January, she was told that the coordinator wouldn’t be able to host her.\n\n“I don’t think she really took me seriously,” Uddin says. “I think she just thought I was some spoiled kid who was getting it all paid for.”\n\nDespite the hiccups, things appeared to be on course the morning of the wedding, when the bride rose at 4:50 a.m. to start her bridal prep. But as the 10 a.m. ceremony grew closer, things were missing, namely a bouquet and the officiant. After waiting 30 minutes, Uddin learned that the officiant had been told that the start time was noon.\n\n“All the guests sat there waiting, not knowing what was going on,” she says. “Kyle was left there thinking, ‘Did she run away? Did she leave me at the altar?’ ”\n\nAbout an hour later, the ceremony finally began, but at the reception, the venue manager and DJ started to shut down the party an hour early, as they hadn’t been informed of the timing goof. Luckily, thanks to a little bibbidi-bobbidi-boo — i.e., multiple calls to Disney representatives — it worked out.\n\n“You expect, for that amount of money, you are going to have an amazing day,” says Uddin, “but it was just a massive mess.”\n\nEven Cinderella’s carriage was a letdown. “You feel like you are sitting in a greenhouse, ... like you are literally being boiled alive,” she says.\n\nAfter multiple complaints, the couple was told that their flower costs would be refunded and that the wedding service director would have “a stern word” with the coordinator. Uddin and Sinnett also were given a free portrait session in the park for their first anniversary. No airfare or lodging included.\n\nUddin’s advice to Disney brides-to-be? “If you want your wedding to be perfect, just do it yourself.”","author":"Megan McDonough, Megan McDonough","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-05T12:00:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/04/Style/Images/145944_0008.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"Gzg1S863zOl4fLOxXVYOjw==\n"}

He’s published a handful of novels through smaller presses, but his most recent work Mongrels earned nominations for the 2016 Stoker and Shirley Jackson awards. Later this summer, he has a novella coming out from Tor.com, Mapping the Interior, and it looks to be a heart-wrenching, creepy read. We have an excerpt for you to check out.\n\nMapping the Interior is about a 15-year-old boy who catches a glimpse of someone he thinks is his mysteriously deceased father. He goes to investigate and discovers that his house is much bigger than he imagined. He launches an attempt to map the house and its mysterious spaces, but is forced to make a terrible choice when he puts his younger brother in danger.\n\nJones noted that the story has influences from authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Philip K. Dick, and Mark Z. Danielewski. Here’s an excerpt from the book, which hits stores on June 20th.\n\nI was twelve the first time I saw my dead father cross from the kitchen doorway to the hall that led back to the utility room.\n\nIt was 2:49 in the morning, as near as I could reconstruct.\n\nI was standing alongside the dusty curtain pulled across the front window of the living room. I wasn’t standing there on purpose. I was in only my underwear. No lights were on.\n\nMy best guess is that, moments before, I’d been looking out the front window, into all the scrub and nothing spread out in front of our house. The reason for thinking that was I had the taste of dust in the back of my throat, and the window had a fine coat of that dust on it. Probably. I’d breathed it in through my nose, because sleepwalkers are goal oriented, not concerned with details or consequences.\n\nIf sleepwalkers cared about that kind of stuff, I’d have at least had my gym shorts on, and, if I was in fact trying to see something outside, then my glasses, too.\n\nTo sleepwalk is to be inhabited, yes, but not by something else, so much. What you’re inhabited by, what’s kicking one foot in front of the other, it’s yourself. It doesn’t make sense, but I don’t think it’s under any real compulsion to, finally. If anything, being inhabited by yourself like that, what it tells you is that there’s a real you squirming down inside you, trying all through the day to pull up to the surface, look out. But it can only get that done when your defenses are down. When you’re sleeping.\n\nThe following morning—this was my usual procedure, after a night of shuffling around dead to the world—would find me out in the sun, poring over the stunted grass and packed dirt for eighty or a hundred feet past the front window. Mom would be at work, and my little brother, Dino, would be glued to one of his cartoons, so there would be nobody there to call out from the porch, ask me what was I doing.\n\nIf I’d had to answer, I’d have said I was looking for whatever it was I’d been looking for last night. My hope was that my waking self had cued on some regularity to the packed dirt’s contour, or registered a dull old pull tab that was actually the lifting ring for a dry old plywood door that opened onto . . . what? I didn’t care. Just something. Anything. An old stash of fireworks, a buried body, a capped-off well; it didn’t matter.\n\nThe day I found something, that would mean that my nighttime ramblings, they had purpose.\n\nOtherwise, I was just broken, right? Otherwise, I was just a toy waking up in the night, bumping into walls.\n\nThat next morning, though, my probing fingers turned up nothing of any consequence. Just the usual trash—little glass bottles, a few bolts with nuts and washers rusted to the thread, part of a dog collar, either the half-buried wheel of a car long gone or the still-attached wheel of a car now buried upside down.\n\nI wanted the latter, of course, but, to allow that possibility, I had to resist digging around the edges of that wheel.\n\nWhen I looked back to the front window of our modular house, I half-expected to see the shape of my dead father again, standing in the window. Watching me.\n\nThe window was just the window, the curtain drawn like Mom said, to keep the heat out.\n\nStill, I watched it.\n\nHow I’d know it was him from a house length out, it wasn’t that I would recognize his face or his build. He’d died when I was four and nearly dying from pneumonia myself, when Dino was one and staying with an aunt so he couldn’t catch pneumonia, when Mom was still working just one shift. All I had to go on as far as how he looked, it was pretty much just snapshots and a blurry memory or two.\n\nNo, the way I’d recognized him the night before, when he was walking from the kitchen doorway back to the utility room, it was his silhouette. There were spikes coming out from his lower back, and the tops of his calves bulged out in an unnatural way, and his head was top-heavy and kind of undulating, so he was going to have to duck to make it into the utility room.\n\nBut—for all he was wearing, he was absolutely silent. Zero rustling, like you can usually hear with a fancydancer, when they’re all set to go, or have just finished.\n\nThing was? My father never danced. He didn’t go to the pow-wows to compete for cash. One of the few things I remember about him, it’s that he didn’t call the traditionals down at the town pump or the IGA “throwbacks,” like I’d heard. His words always got scrambled in his mouth—Dino’s got that too—so that what he came out with, it was “fallback.”\n\nMy father was neither a throwback nor a fallback. He didn’t speak the language, didn’t know the stories, and didn’t care that he didn’t. Once or twice a year, he’d sign on to fight whatever fire was happening, but it wasn’t to protect any ancestral land. It was because when you signed on, they issued you these green wool pants. He’d sell those to the hunters, come fall. Once a year, Mom told me, he’d usually walk home in his boxers, with a twenty folded small in his hand so none of the reservation dogs would nose it away.\n\nThat’s my dad, as I know him.\n\nBut in the year or two after he either drowned or was drowned—there’s stories both ways, and they each make sense—when we were still on the reservation, when his sisters would still watch us some days, they’d tell us about Dad when he was our age and his eyes were still big with dreams.\n\nHe’d been really into bows and arrows and headbands, they said, the toy ones from the trading post. I imagine that when you grow up in a cowboy place, then you’re all into saddles and boots and ropes. When you grow up in Indian country, the TV tells you how to be Indian. And it starts with bows and arrows and headbands. They’re the exciting part of your heritage. They’re also the thing you can always find at the gift shop.\n\nBack then, Dad would always be in the stands at the pow-wows, his sisters told me—well, me and Dino, but Dino was one and two, so I think the stories just skidded right past him, pretty much.\n\nAs for me, I really keyed on that, on my dad watching those dancers with every last bit of his attention, his headband strapped tight over his hair. Like he was trying to soak all this in, so it could fill him up. So he could be that.\n\nWho wouldn’t want to step into a fancydancer outfit? It would be the obvious next step.\n\nThe bustles, the armbands, the beadwork, the cool knee-high moccasins—and the facepaint. It makes you look like the assassin-aliens in space movies. With your face black and white like that, you automatically slit your eyes like a gunfighter, like you’re staring America down across the centuries.\n\nI can see my dad slitting his eyes in the bleachers like that all those years ago. What he’s doing, it’s pretending. What he’s doing, it’s waiting.\n\n“He was going to be the best dancer of us all, once he straightened back up again,” one of his sisters had told me. She wasn’t a dancer herself, but, playing it again in my head, I think she was talking about all the Indians on the whole reservation, maybe even on the whole pow-wow circuit. I think she was saying that if my dad would have just applied the same energy and forethought to his regalia and his routine as he did to what trouble there was to get in once the sun came down, there would have been no stopping him.\n\nThat’s how you talk about dead people, though, especially dead Indians. It’s all about squandered potential, not actual accomplishments.\n\nMy father, my dad, he could have been the best fancydancer of us all.\n\nAnd that’s how I recognized him that first night, crossing from the living room through the kitchen.\n\nHis boots, his bustle. His fancydancer outline.\n\nIn death, he had become what he never could in life.\n\nAnd now he was back.\n\nOr, he had been for a few steps.\n\nMy heart pounded in my chest with what I wanted to call fear but what I know now was actually hope.\n\n#\n\nOur house, like I said, it was modular.\n\nYou can leave the reservation, but your income level will still land you in a reservation house, won’t it? I’d heard my mom say this on the phone once, and it had stuck to the inside of my head in a way I knew I was going to be looking over at that part of the inside of my skull for the rest of my life, probably.\n\nI read once that a baby elephant doesn’t have the digestive enzymes it needs to live, but it can get them—and does—by eating its mother’s dung.\n\nThat’s an old Indian story, right there.\n\nAnyway, the house we were renting, it was 1140 square feet. I knew that from a sticker on the backside of the cabinet under the sink.\n\nSquare feet don’t tell you anything, though.\n\nFor delivery purposes, our house was almost twenty feet wide and nearly three times as long, about. My tape-measuring involved Dino holding it steady for me every twelve feet, though, a red popsicle melting down his left fist, so there could have been some missing inches.\n\nTwenty feet wide sounds like a trailer house, I know, which we’d also lived in, but the difference in a trailer house and modular one, it’s that a modular house, it gets delivered and it stays there, more or less, while a trailer house keeps its wheels and the tongue it gets pulled with, so it can still roam if need be. They’ve both got skirts that never last the winter, though, and the sidings are pretty much the same, and if you end up with one of each, you can kind of rub them together like puffy Cheetos and make a bigger, more complicated house.\n\nI say all this because, the week after I saw my dad in the house, I scoured every single inch of those 1140 square feet for evidence of his having walked through.\n\nWhat I wanted was a single lost bead, just one stray, bright-blue feather. Even a waxy smear on a doorjamb, that could be where he’d touched after he’d wiped an itch on his cheek.\n\nHe was back watching us, I knew.\n\nIt made me sterner with Dino, to prove the good big brother I was being in Dad’s absence. How I was picking up the slack.\n\nIt also made me ask Mom questions about Dad, on as much of the sly as I could manage. What was the first car he had? What was the last? Where did she meet him? What was he doing? Did he name me, or did she? What was the best fight he was ever in? How much could he lift if he had to?\n\nThey’re questions a nine-year-old would ask, I know, not a sixth-grader, but I think when you’re talking about your dad, you kind of go back in years—the more you become a kid, the more he gets to be the dad, right?\n\nSo, we ate crunchy fish sticks over the game shows of dinner, and Mom shrugged and chewed and told me some stories. Not the ones I was ever asking for but ones she remembered from when he was a senior and she was a sophomore. How Dad had come to school with his whole head shaved once, to prove something to a teacher. Or how one time she saw him standing by the lake and throwing a trash bag of shoes into the water, shoe by shoe.\n\nHe hadn’t made it through to graduation—who ever does?—but he’d been there all the same, and he’d clapped louder than anybody, and hooted for every person who crossed the stage, and Mom thought that was probably either the first or the second weekend he ever had to spend in jail.\n\nWhen he died, they didn’t find him right off. The tribal cops, I mean. But everybody knew where he was. Probably some kids from my own class had even snuck out to see him, dragged by their older brothers and sisters, meaning they knew my dad was dead before I did.\n\nWas it because a truck he was driving had thrown a rod he couldn’t afford to pay for, or was it because he was drinking and stumbled, and couldn’t get back up?\n\nThere were stories both ways, and Mom told us that either being true wouldn’t make him alive again, and that—she only said this when she was down—we were maybe better off anyway. We never would have left otherwise.\n\nNow I was going to a school with a higher graduation rate, and there weren’t as many fights.\n\nAlso, there weren’t dogs smiling at us around every corner, or faces we knew in cars driving by, or the snow coming off the mountains the same way, but it was supposed to all be worth it in the end.\n\nAnd, as near as I could tell, there were no beads or feathers or facepaint anywhere in the house. No proof of Dad having walked through. I even checked the vacuum cleaner bag, even though we hardly ever used the vacuum because the smell from the belts always made us have to eat our fish sticks outside.\n\nThat didn’t mean I was done looking, though.\n\nIf I couldn’t find any trace of him, then maybe I could reconstruct what he’d been doing.\n\nOver and over, and slower and slower, I walked what I’d seen of his path from the kitchen to the utility room. Maybe fourteen feet—a little longer than the tape measure would go. I looked at every chair back and coffee-table edge and wall he could have brushed by, that he could have touched with his fingertips the way I imagine the dead touch solid things: with wonder.\n\nThen I backtracked, figured he must have crossed the living room before crossing the kitchen, right? Which meant he’d walked right behind me when I was standing there asleep, looking out into the driveway—meaning that, maybe, my sleeping self had heard his ghost truck pull up out there. That truck with the thrown rod, the truck he’d killed, that had maybe killed him. I’d heard it and risen to watch him walk up, but, asleep, I’d been too slow. He’d probably been coming through the front door right as I was parting the curtain, and then had been walking behind me when my sleeping eyes were trying to see out into the dark. It was pure luck that I’d sensed motion in my peripheral vision, and that flurry of movement had shaken me awake, pulled my head around to barely catch him slipping out the kitchen.\n\nTo the utility room.\n\nMom caught me in there when she got home from work.\n\nI had her roll of duct tape, was tearing some out, then pressing it to every surface in there, trying to lift something that would prove I’d seen what I’d seen.\n\n“Junior?” she said, standing in the doorway.\n\nI didn’t try to explain. What I asked her instead was were there any secret compartments in here, or any old photo albums, or maybe a box of old leftover clothes, something like that?\n\nShe didn’t answer, just watched me some more.\n\n“What have you been reading?” she asked.\n\nOur questions were going right past each other, as usual.\n\nAnother effect Dad being back was having was that I was less patient with Mom now. Quicker to dismiss her. I mean, sure, that could be part of being twelve. But I think it was my way of siding with my dad, too.\n\nI don’t claim to be smart or good or right or any of that.\n\nMy name’s “Junior,” after all. I’m my father’s son.\n\n#\n\nWhen two thirty rolled around that morning, I was rooted to the exact same spot by the front window. I was even still wearing the exact same underwear. The only difference was that I had my glasses on now. I hoped they wouldn’t mess everything up.\n\nWhat I’d also done, just on the chance this was key, was deadfoot it into the living room. It was something I’d learned at my new school, listening in: if both your feet fell asleep and you walked around anyway, you could accidentally step into some other world. I figured that’s maybe what had happened to me the night before—my feet had been asleep but I’d walked on them anyway, into some other . . . not plane, I don’t think, but like a shade over, or deeper, or shallower, where I could see more than I could otherwise.\n\nThe difference, it was that I wasn’t asleep. To try to make up for it, I’d snaked one of Dino’s jump ropes—they were supposed to teach him to count, if anything ever would—and pythoned it tight around my thighs until the beds of my toenails had started to darken.\n\nMy concern now was that, by being early so as to be sure not to miss anything, I was also insuring that my feet would be awake by 2:49, and I’d be standing in the same waking level or depth I was standing in every other day.\n\nAt 2:43, the skin on the outside of each of my feet started to tingle and pinprick. I hotfooted it back and forth without thinking, then just stood there looking down at what was happening. Circulation. It was ruining everything.\n\nI could gamble that it didn’t matter what my blood was doing, and whether that blood was somehow connected to my brain in a way that nudged my vision over just enough, or . . . I did it, I sat down right there and tied my legs off one more time, tighter than before, and pulled the rope between my teeth instead of knotting it like last time.\n\nThis time, it hurt. I think it was because all the blood that had just got to go back where it was supposed to have been, it had only been starting to make the turn, suck back up to my heart, but now I was shutting it off again. It felt like my feet were balloons. When they weren’t supposed to feel like anything.\n\nI pulled tighter, closing my eyes, leaning back to do it, and then jerked forward when our dog Chuckhead brushed my bare back with his mangy, matted coat.\n\nAn instant after that, I remembered that Chuckhead hadn’t come with us down here. He was living on the streets now, was trying to put on fat for winter, or else becoming fat for one of the bigger dogs.\n\nMeaning?\n\nI twisted around, letting the jump rope sling past my mouth, the handle taking a chunk of lipmeat with it, but I was alone. It wasn’t the air conditioner or the fan, either. Mom kept the fan in her room mostly, and the air conditioner parasited onto the back window behind the TV was rusted shut.\n\nI stood, forgetting I was supposed to be watching for some wavery version of headlights in front of the house.\n\nHad it been a feather that brushed the skin of my back? The ermine cuff of a fancy moccasin? The lightest brush of a porcupine quill from a bustle?\n\nHad my dad reached down with his fingertips to touch the back of his oldest son, because that was the most he could do?\n\nI reached my hand as far around as I could.\n\nAnother thing I’d learned at school, it was “canteen kiss.” It’s when you drink after a girl you like, or she drinks after you.\n\nThis was like that, I guess.\n\nIf my dad had touched me, then there was some kind of countdown where I could touch where he’d touched, and it would matter.\n\nIt was two fifty. Then it was three. I had school the next morning.\n\nI policed my area, being sure there was no evidence of my nocturnal activities—no explanation would cover me out here, mostly naked with a jump rope and a prayer—and walked the uncreaky parts of the floor back to my room, stopping to check on Dino for good measure.\n\nHe was spasming in his bed.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time.\n\nMom swore she’d not had a drop of anything while carrying him, but still, and lately more and worse, he was kind of . . . It was like there was something in his head not quite making a complete connection. Like the way he wasn’t learning his numbers or his letters when, by the third grade, he definitely should have. The school had him on some special learning plan already, but there was talk of special classes now, and special teachers that talk so soft and nice it’s terrifying, like they’re about to eat you.\n\nAt the bus stop, if I didn’t stop it, the other kids would push him back and forth between them like playing pinball. And Dino didn’t mind. He liked being part of the game, I think.\n\nThe last month or two, though, he’d started zoning out in the middle of meals, or while watching a game show, or just while standing looking out a window.\n\nAnd now this.\n\n“Mom,” I called out, just loud enough to wake her, not loud enough that she’d hurt herself trying to crash down the hall, “Dino’s having another seizure.”\n\nThis would be his fifth or sixth. That we knew about.\n\nBy the time Mom got there with the warm rag she was sure helped, I had the leg of one of Dino’s superhero action figures between his teeth. In the Western movies, they always use a belt or a wallet in the mouth. It’s never for a seizure, it’s usually for a bullet, but the principle’s the same, I figured.\n\nAfter a few minutes of it, Dino settled down.\n\nI stood to go to bed.\n\n“What were you doing up with that?” Mom said.\n\nI looked down to the jump rope evidently still hanging around my neck.\n\n“Water,” I lied, like that was any kind of explanation, and then made good on that lie, felt my way to the sink.\n\nOn the way back across the linoleum of the kitchen, my bare foot kicked something that rocketed away. Something light and plastic and round.\n\nMy heart registered it the moment it hit the wall under the table, and then my hands reacted just about the exact instant it tapped against the roulette wheel of the heater vent in the floor.\n\nMy mouth named it while it was still falling down that ductwork: “Bead.”\n\nOne single bead.\n\nIt was as big as the whole rest of the world.","author":"Andrew Liptak","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T14:00:02.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-I2goRckMu8hDtWSdZwF8C5VCQI=/0x829:1500x1673/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54653029/mappingtheinterior_FINAL.0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"/40juZ88VGR4ighDyNRMCA==\n"}

Both serve as supporting roles to fairly generic heroes; both are fierce and capable in combat; both have haircuts that would make the average person look incredibly stupid; and both are inexplicably wide-eyed about the world.\n\nJonathan McIntosh, who goes by Pop Culture Detective on YouTube, published a video exploring this trope, which he calls “born sexy yesterday.” These female characters are wise, but also strikingly naive about the world. They’re childlike, and yet they’re also designed to appeal to heterosexual men.\n\n“Characters who are born sexy yesterday are often highly skilled at something that men will respect,” McIntosh says. “Frequently, that thing is combat.”\n\nMcIntosh, who also worked on a few videos for pop criticism site Feminist Frequency, calls this phenomenon a relationship trope. It’s not so different from the infamous Manic Pixie Dream Girl archetype. Like the MPDG, a Born Sexy Yesterday character is typically introduced to a straight, “red-blooded man” who is alone or unhappy in the love department. He’s directionless or disenfranchised with his life. But in the case of Born Sexy Yesterday, the trope goes a step further because this man, McIntosh says, “either can’t find or doesn’t want a woman from his own world who might be his equal in matters of love or sexuality.”\n\nThe trope isn’t new or even exclusive to sci-fi\n\nThe trope isn’t new or even exclusive to sci-fi. McIntosh explores its history in films like Forbidden Planet or The Time Machine, as well as its appearance in mediums like anime. The problem with the trope, he says, is that its subtext is “rooted in a deep-seated male insecurity around sex and sexuality.” The trope could improve, he posits, if both characters were inexperienced and explored their identities together, or if these women were given the chance to grow in their experiences — like Star Trek: Voyager’s Seven of Nine.\n\n“The crux of the trope is a fixation on male superiority, a fixation with holding power over an innocent girl,” McIntosh says. “But in order to make that socially acceptable, science fiction has employed to put the mind of that girl into a sexualized, adult women’s body.”\n\nThe trope does exist in reverse as well. Kind of. Men who exhibit the same traits in film, like Big or Blast from the Past, are more often used as the butt of the joke. “Perhaps that’s because most grown women don’t find the idea of dating an inexperienced adolescent boy all that appealing,” McIntosh says. Truer words have never been spoken.","author":"Megan Farokhmanesh","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T18:00:02.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LVXBySW3r42LSdpAMOUN1ujnVKw=/54x0:1387x750/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54653215/Screen_Shot_2017_05_05_at_10.11.19_AM.0.png","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"/qukktmsmfLwSxLazWK8Jw==\n"}

About Facebook, they contend that the San Bernardino shooters, including Tashfeen Malik, had declared their allegiance to ISIS in a previous Facebook post. As for Google, they allege that it essentially helps fund ISIS through advertisements that run before YouTube videos.\n\nSpokespeople for all three companies did not immediately comment for this story.\n\nThe attack in December 2015 ignited fierce debate about the role of the tech industry in protecting national security. In the months after the attack, then-President Barack Obama and others in Washington pushed Silicon Valley to play a greater role in policing its platforms for potential threats. While companies have made progress, combatting radical organizations remains a major challenge. Google, in particular, has faced blowback from brands whose ads have appeared alongside other extremist content.\n\nOther in government would like to see tech companies make it easier for law enforcement to access their services and devices. That stance led to another court spat between the FBI and Apple, as investigators sought to force the company to crack a password-protected iPhone tied to the attack. Ultimately, the FBI gained entry into the device on its own.\n\nFamilies of victims of other attacks similarly have taken aim at the tech industry. The relatives of a woman who was killed during the 2015 attack in Paris sued Facebook, Google and Twitter last year, specifically citing the fact they profited from ads on extremist videos. A number of families sued the same companies in March following the deadly June 2016 attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.","author":"Tony Romm","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T17:42:36.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YC_ulLg5VWpcDA4rmd6ePW3CLqE=/0x160:3000x1848/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54662033/499792080.0.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"O97EU1TkqRiH49eT9dzx8g==\n"}

Even before the last-minute attempt at sabotage, the election represented a big step into the political unknown for France — the first time in more than 50 years that neither of the establishment parties will be represented in the final round.\n\nInstead, voters will choose one of two starkly different candidates who have each pledged to change the system, though in radically different ways.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Le Pen, a fierce nationalist, wants to take France out of the European Union and restore the franc.

Can either candidate, as an outsider, really be effective as president?\n\nNeither has ever held national elected office. Each lacks any real base of support in Parliament and will be trying to build one from the ground up. The president of France is powerful only if he or she has a majority in Parliament to help push through his or her party’s program.\n\nThat uncertainty may ripple through Europe, which will be watching closely to gauge both the strength of far-right forces in France and the depth of the anti-European Union sentiment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe differences between the candidates are so deep that the winner will surely be seen as a harbinger of Europe’s future.

It is being especially closely watched in Germany, which holds parliamentary elections in September, as well as in Italy, which could also hold elections this year.\n\nIn particular, a close eye will be kept on Ms. Le Pen’s share of the vote, which will serve as a gauge of the current strength of the populist tide that last year ushered Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump to power in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the final polls, Mr. Macron was heavily favored to win — by as much as 20 percentage points. Still, the polls come after a long season of staggering electoral upsets around the world and in the face of the last-minute hacking of Mr. Macron’s campaign accounts.\n\nAnalysts were unsure what the impact of the hacking might be. Thomas Guénolé, a political-science professor at Sciences Po, one of France’s best universities, said the hacking was part of a larger trend in France toward “an Americanization of French politics,” citing scandals, leaks and fake news, as well as increased focus on the images of the candidates.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On French social media, the tone of tweets and Facebook posts was more mocking than outraged, and many French people seemed unaware of the hacking.\n\n“I didn’t know about the leaks but now that I know about it, it won’t change my vote,” said Audrey Payet, a 33-year-old day care worker, in central Paris. She said she planned on abstaining because she did not want to choose between “a racist party and a banker party.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo matter who wins, the country will be abandoning a political order that has shaped it for the last 59 years, when it was dominated by the country’s two mainstream parties — the Socialist Party and the center-right Republicans. This election has been shaped by new issues and resulted in an electorate effectively divided into quarters across the political spectrum, including left and right extremes and Mr. Macron’s new centrist movement, En Marche! (“On Our Way!”).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We are changing into a four-party system that has never existed before in France in the Fifth Republic, and that does not exist elsewhere in large European countries,” Mr. Bussereau said.\n\nIn the first round of the presidential vote, on April 23, the Socialist Party all but collapsed, its candidate receiving just 6.4 percent of the vote. The sitting president, François Hollande, a Socialist, is so unpopular that he became the first president in decades not to seek a second mandate. The candidate of the mainstream right, François Fillon, an experienced former prime minister, took about 20 percent of the vote in the first round after being tarnished by a nepotism scandal that led to embezzlement charges.\n\nVideo\n\nA big question now is where those voters will turn — to the center with Mr. Macron or farther to the right with Ms. Le Pen. Also in play are the 19 percent of voters who went in the first round with the far-left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Many of his voters may abstain, in effect aiding Ms. Le Pen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoth the far left and the far right were animated by their deep resistance to globalization — be that economic, cultural or related to immigration — and it became a clear dividing line in the campaign. The issue has become a new and increasingly important political fissure in France and in Europe more broadly, and is breaking down traditional left-right political divisions. Instead, the political spectrum is being divided among winners and losers.\n\n“It’s a consequence of the social-economic impact of globalization,” Mr. Guénolé, the political scientist, said. “More and more people are feeling precarious.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat much was clear in the outcome of the first round of voting.\n\nMs. Le Pen and her far-right National Front hewed to a hard protectionist, anti-European line and took a strongly nationalist position on French identity. She depicted herself as a “patriot.” Mr. Macron openly embraced the European Union, calling for more integration, saying that France was already part of the global community, its immigrants inextricably a part of the nation’s fabric.\n\n“There is not a French culture — there is a culture in France and it is diverse,” Mr. Macron said at a rally in Lyon.\n\nEven if Mr. Macron wins handily, as projected, his victory will chiefly reflect voters’ opposition to Ms. Le Pen and the National Front. The party remains anathema to large parts of the French electorate, in view of its history of anti-Semitism, racism, and apologias for France’s collaborators with the Nazis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet the lines that now fissure French politics mean that neither of the two candidates facing each other in the runoff Sunday received even a quarter of the votes in the first round. Mr. Macron took 24 percent and Ms. Le Pen took 21 percent. That suggests that no matter who wins, their overall support will be relatively narrow.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Even if he wins 60 percent of the vote, that does not mean that 60 percent of the French have voted for Emmanuel Macron,” said Alexis Massart, director of the European School of Political and Social Science at the University of Lille. “A part of that 60 percent voted against Marine Le Pen,” he said.\n\nThat will leave Mr. Macron, if he does succeed Sunday, in a vulnerable position. While the outcome of the first round was a political earthquake for France, just how big remains to be seen.\n\nFor now, the French electorate seems more divided than at any time in recent memory. Much will hang on parliamentary elections in June — an electoral one-two punch that gives voters yet another chance to consider the direction of the country, with the potential to either thrust France forward or prolong the ongoing paralysis.","author":"Alissa J.

(Charles Platiau/Reuters)\n\nMarine Le Pen, the 48-year-old heiress to a far-right party once considered beyond the pale in French political life, failed to capture the presidency on Sunday night. But she has undeniably broadened the appeal of the National Front, and is poised to capitalize on the party’s growing power and play a more authoritative role in opposing the new government.\n\nLe Pen was thwarted by Emmanuel Macron, who won roughly 65 percent of the vote, according to early projections. He is a former investment banker and Socialist finance minister who led an insurgent bid under the banner of a brand-new party to the presidential palace. But together they broke the French political establishment, banishing from the final round the two parties--the Socialists and the Republicans-- that have ruled Frances since 1958.\n\nLe Pen, in brief remarks conceding defeat, claimed the country’s political reorganization as a victory for her and for the populist protest roiling the West.\n\n“The first round led to a major reconfiguration of the French political landscape,” she said. “The second round led to a reconfiguration between patriots and globalists.”\n\nShe promised that the National Front would be the “first force of opposition,” though she also acknowledged that her party would have to “renew itself to live up to this moment.”\n\n[The dark history at the heart of the French election ]\n\nThis year’s contest marked only the second time that Le Pen’s party, from which she formally distanced herself in a last-ditch effort to broaden her appeal, made it to the run-off. In 2002, her father Jean-Marie, who is one of the National Front’s founders and still embodies its roots in anti-Semitism, shocked France by advancing to the second round, only to win just 18 percent of the vote. Fifteen years later, Le Pen — who dates her political consciousness to 1976, when dynamite intended for the family patriarch tore through their Paris apartment — nearly doubled that figure.\n\nStill, the outcome was a stinging setback for Le Pen, who was hoping to ride an apparent populist, anti-establishment wave — beginning in Britain last summer with Brexit and coursing through the United States in the fall with the election of Donald Trump — into power. Far-right, populist parties have also risen in Hungary and Poland. French voters stopped Le Pen short, choosing instead a relative political novice who promised an open orientation to the world and succor to immigrants\n\nLe Pen, who grew up in one of France’s richest districts, proved an imperfect vessel of anti-elite protest, just as the National Front, which has been a fixture of French politics for decades, failed to inoculate itself against its own anti-establishment invective. Looking for alternatives to politics as usual, many voters remained skeptical that Le Pen offered anything but a retreat into the darkest chapters of France’s past, or a step into the unknown.\n\n“It’s a danger for our democracy,” said Céline Denain, a 32-year-old artist, who pointed to her pregnant belly to explain why a Le Pen presidency was unthinkable to her. “It would be the worst.” She lodged a protest vote, for the far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in the first round but rallied behind Macron on Sunday.\n\n[Macron’s strong finish in the French election shows populist wave may be ebbing]\n\nNow, the National Front turns to June legislative elections, analysts and party leaders said, the aim being to make it impossible for Macron to govern. The party currently boasts a meager two deputies in the National Assembly but could easily gain the requisite seats, 15, to form an official parliamentary group. This would grant it the capacity to form part of the official opposition to the ruling party, to gain additional speaking time in parliament and to hold more sway in powerful government commissions.\n\nThen there is the question of 2022.\n\n“Too soon to say for now,” said Nonna Mayer, a political scientist at Sciences Po in Paris and an expert on the far right, when asked whether Le Pen would run a third time for president. Mayer enumerated several hurdles, including the June elections, and other regional and local contests, as well as divisions within the movement. Party unity, she said, is threatened by a disagreement between newer followers of the National Front attracted to its doctrine of economic nationalism, a message honed by top aide and party vice-president Florian Philippot, and those who crave a harder line on religious and social issues. The latter group sees its views represented by Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, who may come to pose a leadership challenge to her own relative, Mayer said.\n\nBut Christophe Boutin, a political scientist at the University of Caen, said these divisions are overstated. He expects Marine Le Pen to run again in 2022.\n\n“I hope, I hope,” said Marie-Christine Arnautu, a National Front member of the European Parliament and a longtime associate of the Le Pen family, when asked if the unsuccessful candidate would stand again. Arnautu served as a spokesperson for Le Pen during her 2012 presidential campaign, which failed to break into the second round. She speaks glowingly of Le Pen as the “sole solution for France” and, under Macron’s presidency, predicted “more terrorism, more unemployment, more social misery.”\n\nBut Arnautu also exemplifies the party’s internal tensions. Sanctioned last year for participating in a rally organized by the exiled Jean-Marie Le Pen, in which he questioned his daughter’s leadership, she represents a wing of the party still wedded to a stricter stance on social issues, such as opposition to gay marriage. Le Pen’s promise was economic revival — notably by yanking France from the Euro and holding a referendum on exit from the European Union — not a new offensive in the country’s culture wars.\n\nArnautu played down these disagreements. She called for unity around the party’s central pledge — saving “the heart of France” from Europe — and predicted that it would gain many seats in the June parliamentary elections, welcoming voters fleeing the humbled parties that did not make it past the first round of presidential elections last month.\n\n[In French election, voters face a choice that mirrors the West’s new divide]\n\nGrowing support for the National Front owes to Le Pen’s efforts, since she took its helm in 2011, to “de-demonize” the party and discipline its message, analysts said. She has sought to present a movement shorn of its ugliest strains, such as denial of the Holocaust; she formally banished her father in 2015. But French media -- as recently as last week -- have continued to expose Holocaust denial in the highest ranks of the party’s leadership, and despite the purported ‘estrangement’ between father and daughter, Le Pen ultimately accepted a 6 million euro loan from her father late last year to finance her struggling campaign. The same year, her party claimed victory in the first round of regional elections, after winning France’s elections to the European Parliament outright in 2014. Party members said her electoral gains are the result of years spent cultivating economically dislocated regions of the country, remote from its cosmopolitan urban centers.\n\nUnder Le Pen, the party has made major inroads in once left-leaning parts of the country’s postindustrial northeast, parts of which are now governed by a peculiar patchwork of Socialist and National Front officials. Its traditional base of support has been in the south, where anti-immigrant sentiment is most powerfully felt. But many voters in once-prosperous, mid-sized towns who have not reaped the rewards of globalized markets have gravitated to the far right, whose leaders promise tightened borders, a new industrial push and protections for workers whose jobs are threatened by globalization.\n\nThe phenomenon finds a parallel in Donald Trump’s triumph in the hardest-hit parts of America’s Rust Belt.\n\n“For too long, French elites have not resembled the country and its voters,” Bernard Monot, an economist and delegate to the European Parliament representing the National Front, wrote in an email.\n\nWith this message, a claim that her movement represents the interests of the underserved majority, Le Pen has steadily sought to move the party into the mainstream. In spite of her loss, modest success was evident not just in the percentage of the vote she captured but in the endorsement after the first round of voting of Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, the leader of a rival right-wing, Eurosceptic party.\n\n“She is much more elevated than her father was in 2002,” said Bruno Cautrès, a political scientist at Sciences Po. “Dupont-Aignan presents himself as a Gaullist, and even if it’s a small party, it’s a relationship for the National Front. It shows the party is no longer isolated.”\n\nYet Sunday’s decisive defeat also suggested that Le Pen’s support may have hit a hard ceiling, and that, despite her effort to brush up the party’s image and distance herself from some of her father’s most incendiary rhetoric, the family’s politics remain unacceptable to much of the country. Le Pen gave fresh cause for doubt about the distance between her views and those of her father, a convicted Holocaust denier, when she said last month that France was not responsible for a massive, wartime round-up of Jews in Paris.\n\n“This is not a democratic party; it is a family party,” said Philippe Blacher, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Lyon. “It doesn’t truly evolve. The same lies and insults just come from a new member of the family.”\n\nRead more\n\nObama endorses Macron in French election, taking a side in Europe again\n\nAs French elections loom, one town offers hints of what far-right rule could look like\n\nFrench election could bring a jolt to Western security, no matter who wins\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":"Isaac Stanley-Becker, Isaac Stanley-Becker","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T07:41:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/07/Foreign/Images/2017-05-07T162343Z_2033868831_RC11A8DE6F00_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"AfUYEEwY1uNWcypn9VfNaQ==\n"}

It was Mr Macron's promise of renewal and change that won him his place in the Elysée Palace.\n\nHe has promised fresh faces from outside politics, an overhaul of the established political system and a new kind morality in political life.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Could it be IMF head Christine Lagarde?\n\nHis En Marche! (English: On The Move) movement has the feel of a start-up, with the average age said to be around 30. But he is also going to need experience, particularly in areas such as security.\n\nWho to watch in Macron's team\n\nAlexis Kohler, 43: Special adviser and likely to be Mr Macron's secretary general at the Elysée. Joined a shipping company after working as chief-of-staff for Mr Macron while in government\n\nBrigitte Trogneux, 64: President-elect's wife initially helped rewrite his speeches but is said to seek role as a \"bridge\" to the president\n\nIsmaël Emelien, 29: Right-hand man and longtime friend, head of communications and strategic adviser, ex-colleague in economy ministry\n\nJean Pisani-Ferry, 65: Economics professor and government adviser, in charge of Macron economic programme and big ideas. Founded Brussels-based Bruegel think tank\n\nSophie Gagnant-Ferracci, 40: Head of campaign team. Highly experienced corporate lawyer and longstanding friend of president-elect through her husband, economist Marc Ferracci\n\nFrançois Bayrou, 65: Political heavyweight, head of centrist Democratic Movement party; his backing boosted Macron candidacy in February\n\n\"The young technocrats that surround Macron are impatient for their go,\" says Pierre Haski, former deputy editor at the left-wing newspaper Libération.\n\n\"They think the oldies have made a mess of things… [but] Emmanuel Macron needs to find a balance between the traditional big beasts of the main parties and the newcomers. It can't just be the younger generation.\"\n\nBalancing the expectations of sweeping change with the demands of government will not be easy, especially as he is likely to face a politically diverse cabinet - and probably a divided parliament too.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Brigitte Trogneux (R, with Mr Macron) is reportedly seeking a role in her husband's administration\n\nAnd that is the second challenge for Mr Macron: the unique blend of left and right that he promised in his campaign means that his cabinet will need to contain not just a mix of fresh faces and old hands, but a mix of figures from the established right and left.\n\n'Unprecedented territory'\n\nThere have been several high-profile figures from both sides who have backed him for president but until now his supporters have not had to sever their existing party memberships and some have already made it clear that voting for him as president is not the same as supporting his programme in government.\n\nBut lack of clarity has never left politics starved of speculation and since Mr Macron's hint on his pick for prime minister, there has been renewed interest in who might be given a position of power.\n\nA poll published on Friday suggested that the head of the IMF and former Economy Minister, Christine Lagarde, would be the most popular choice for prime minister.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Defence Minister Yves Le Drian (L) has also been mooted as Mr Macron's pick for PM\n\nSome analysts believe she is a good option for Mr Macron because, while she has experience of ministerial office, she has never actually been elected and so may qualify as part of his political renewal.\n\nOther names that have cropped up include the current Defence Minister, Yves Le Drian. His appointment would be a \"reassuring gesture\", says Haski, and significant, given far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen's attacks on Macron as soft on terrorism.\n\nFurther names touted for senior positions include the centrist François Bayrou and the MEP Sylvie Goulard.\n\nBut this is all unprecedented territory, says Haski. \"We've never been through this before: a team created from scratch.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Mr Macron defeated Ms Le Pen in both rounds of voting\n\nEn Marche was only created a year before its leader was elected. And with no established party structure and no real campaign manager, responsibility was parcelled out to managers in different policy areas.\n\nFrenetic activity\n\nThe only one who knows Mr Macron's mind, said one analyst, is probably his wife Brigitte Trogneux.\n\nMany say she is unlikely to be given a prominent political role, even though she has played a key part in her husband's campaign. Their relationship has been controversial - 24 years his senior, Brigitte met her future husband when she taught him drama at school - and Mr Macron has been stern about politicians employing family members.\n\nAs if this was not amorphous enough, in a month's time the new president-elect will face another round of elections - for the French parliament. All 577 posts are up for election and En Marche! has vowed to run candidates in every seat.\n\nAn absolute majority would be a \"political miracle\", unexpected even by those close to Mr Macron such as mentor Alain Minc.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mr Macron campaigned on a pro-EU platform\n\n\"They'll have to make a coalition,\" he told me. \"I don't believe at all that he's able to have 280 MPs coming from En Marche! with half of them beginning in politics and chosen from 14,000 CVs sent by email.\"\n\nThe result is that Emmanuel Macron may find governing very difficult. His experience as economy minister taught him that building cross-party consensus for each individual issue can be draining and dispiriting. Much will depend on whether En Marche! can form a stable coalition to stand a chance of getting its reforms passed.\n\nIn that sense, the coming days will be a time of frenetic activity for Team Macron, as high-profile figures from both the centre-right Republicans and the centre-left Socialist Party absorb the scale of his win and the future direction of political power in France.\n\nSome may leave their parties to join him - if there are enough of them, it could sign the death warrant for France's two main parties. But it is a fine balance for Mr Macron: he needs enough of them on board the boat to stabilise it, but too many and his political vision is sunk. Just do not mention the rabbit.","author":"BBC News","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T18:43:33.000Z"},"source":"bbc-news","urlToImage":"https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/55CA/production/_95926912_mediaitem95926908.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"hwmJ59Dez5K2lQGg+7cZtA==\n"}

Everyone told us it was impossible, but they don't know France.\"\n\nBut he repeated a number of times that the task facing him and the country was enormous.\n\nHe said: \"We have the strength, the energy and the will - and we will not give in to fear.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nHis mention of Ms Le Pen drew loud boos, and he said he would do all he could to ensure in future there would be no reason to vote for extremism.\n\nSecurity remains tight in the capital and there were reports of police firing tear gas at several hundred anti-capitalist protesters near the Ménilmontant metro in the 20th arrondissement.\n\nWhat has Ms Le Pen said?\n\nIn her speech, she thanked the estimated 11 million people who had voted for her. She said the election had shown a division between \"patriots and globalists\" and called for the emergence of a new political force.\n\nMs Le Pen said her National Front party needed to renew itself and that she would start the \"deep transformation of our movement\", vowing to lead it into upcoming parliamentary elections.\n\nShe also said she had wished Mr Macron success in tackling the \"huge challenges\" facing him.\n\nSubdued and blue: BBC's James Reynolds at Le Pen HQ\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\n\"It's the people who decide,\" Marine Le Pen told me during the final days of the run-off campaign.\n\nThe people have now decided that they don't want her as their president. Ms Le Pen lost this election comprehensively.\n\nBut in winning more than 30% of the run-off vote, she has taken a significant step towards her goal of making her movement respectable and electable.\n\nMs Le Pen may now try to broaden her party's approach. She'll even re-name her party, on the assumption that the National Front's name is an obstacle to winning over more voters.\n\nAt the party's campaign headquarters on election night, supporters carried blue-coloured roses, Ms Le Pen's favoured symbol. She even danced to I Love Rock and Roll.\n\nIt may have been a strange way for a beaten presidential hopeful to spend the night, but this party has long term plans. Supporters will save their blue roses for 2022.\n\nRead more: What does Marine Le Pen do now?\n\nWhat does Mr Macron stand for?\n\nHe is a liberal centrist, pro-business and a strong supporter of the European Union.\n\nHe left the Socialist government of President François Hollande last August to form his new movement - En Marche - saying it was neither left nor right wing.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Emmanuel Macron's unconventional route to political stardom in France\n\nHis campaign pledges included a 120,000 reduction in public-sector jobs, a cut in public spending by €60bn (£50bn; $65bn), and a lowering of the unemployment rate to below 7%.\n\nHe vowed to ease labour laws and give new protections to the self-employed.\n\nMr Macron also stood on a pro-EU platform, in stark contrast to his opponent.\n\nWill his charm work? BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nOften with Emmanuel Macron one fears that (in a way that is very French) it is words that are doing his work. Words that are bridging the divides; words that are flattering his opponents; words that create the devotion that, among some, he inspires.\n\nIn the campaign it became a joke among journalists how often his answers included the words \"au meme temps\" (at the same time). It was his way of marrying everything and its opposite, of reconciling every contradiction.\n\nHe got away with it because he is who he is.\n\nBut in the real life of running a fractious, angry, divided country - will his words have the same effect? Will his solitary self-belief create the structures of political support which he needs in the rough-and-tumble of government? Will his charm still work?\n\nRead more from Hugh\n\nWhat has the immediate international reaction been?\n\nMost of those running the EU were breathing a sigh of relief, given Ms Le Pen's policies and last year's Brexit vote.\n\nEuropean Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted: \"Happy that the French chose a European future.\"\n\nMeanwhile, US President Donald Trump tweeted his congratulations to Mr Macron for the \"big win\" and said he looked forward to working with him.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Parisians say they are relieved Mr Macron has beaten Ms Le Pen\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel tweeted her congratulations, saying Mr Macron's win was a \"victory for a strong united Europe\".\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May said: \"France is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new president.\"\n\nFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage sounded a dissonant note, saying: \"Macron offers five more years of failure\" and encouraging Ms Le Pen to \"stick in there\".\n\nAt home, President François Hollande congratulated Mr Macron and said the result showed the French people wanted to unite around the \"values of the republic\".\n\nWhat will be Macron's immediate difficulties?\n\nWell, his En Marche grouping has no seats in parliament at all.\n\nLegislative elections follow on quickly from the presidential poll - on 11 and 18 June.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Macron says he has heard the \"rage and anxiety\" of the people\n\nEn Marche will contest the elections as a party but Mr Macron may find himself needing to pull together a coalition to govern effectively.\n\nAlthough his presidential candidacy had support from other political parties, much of it stemmed from the need to defeat Ms Le Pen. More than 25% of the electorate abstained from voting, while a record 11.5% of ballots were left blank or spoilt.\n\nHe will need to win over the abstainers and those who are sceptical about his political vision. Left-wing voters in particular felt disenfranchised by the choice of the final two candidates.\n\nMr Macron will also need to tackle the fallout from a hacking attack on Friday, the final day of campaigning, when a trove of documents relating to his campaign, said to include both genuine and fake documents, was released online.\n\nDid you cast your vote?

It would be used for investment in school nurses and counselling services in primary and secondary schools in England.\n\n'Bold action'\n\nA future Labour government would also measure progress in child health against international standards as part of an \"ambition to make Britain's children the healthiest in the world\", the party said.\n\nLabour's Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \"The scandal of child ill-health is a long-standing, growing and urgent challenge.\n\n\"It should be a matter of shame that a child's health is so closely linked to poverty and that where and in what circumstances you grow up can dramatically affect your life chances.\"\n\nHe added: \"When it comes to our children we should be ambitious. It's time we invested properly in the health of the next generation. That means the sort of bold action we are outlining today to tackle obesity and invest in mental health provision.\"\n\nThe Conservatives' childhood obesity plan announced last August set out the action local communities, the food industry, schools and the NHS should be taking over the next 10 years.\n\nIt was criticised by health experts, the health select committee and campaigners for being \"weak\" and \"watered down\".\n\nBut Tory public health spokesman Nicola Blackwood said: \"Reducing childhood obesity is vital. That's why the public health watchdog says that the childhood obesity plan we've put in place is the most ambitious in the world, and why we have one of the strictest TV advertising regimes of any country.\n\n\"We spent £3.4bn on public health programmes last year - that can only be funded by a strong economy which Jeremy Corbyn would risk with his nonsensical economic ideas.\"","author":"BBC News","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T20:59:58.000Z"},"source":"bbc-news","urlToImage":"https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1451A/production/_95962238_boystv.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"54ZhyBQJXYfc+pRguVA8yg==\n"}

So it's good, and it is definitely improving.\"\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Itoje also discussed being the youngest member of the Lions squad, Muhammad Ali, and the importance of his faith.\n\nDespite only being 22, Maro Itoje is the reigning European Player of the Year\n\n'Lions is going to be eye-opening'\n\nItoje made his England debut in 2016 and his 12 caps have included two Six Nations titles - including a Grand Slam in 2016 - plus a 3-0 series whitewash of Australia down under last summer.\n\nHis performances for club and country have earned him a place in Warren Gatland's 41-man Lions squad to face New Zealand this summer.\n\nAs the youngest member of the squad, he will have the responsibility of looking after the soft-toy tour mascot, Billy.\n\n\"I've heard that players try and sabotage it,\" he said. \"I am going to have to keep quite it tight to me, I don't think I can trust anybody, I heard there are some severe punishments.\"\n\nSpeaking about the tour, he added: \"I am looking forward to the whole experience.

Whether you liked him or not you still respected him. For me, he is well and truly the greatest.\n\n\"For me the biggest [thing] was how he put his religious and political beliefs before the boxing. He wasn't afraid of speaking out, when other athletes were afraid of speaking out.\n\n\"He wasn't doing this at the end [of his career], he started doing this when he was 21, when he was world champion. He's just an incredible person to look up to.\"\n\nItoje, who is a devout Christian, added: \"Once you reach a certain level - play for your club and your country - naturally you get a bit of a following and have people of a younger generation looking up to you.\n\n\"You go on the pitch and try and play your best and give the best representation of yourself. The by-product of doing that stuff well is people of a younger generation will follow, in the way that when I was a younger player, watching the greats of the past were the same kind of inspiration.\"\n\n'Champions Cup is going to be special'\n\nMaro Itoje was named man of the match in last year's Champions Cup final as Saracens beat Racing 92\n\nItoje, who can play lock or blind-side flanker, was named man of the match as Saracens became champions of Europe for the first time as they beat Top 14 side Racing 92 in Lyon last May.\n\nOn Saturday in Edinburgh they face two-time runners-up Clermont, who have finished second in France's top division regular season to qualify for the play-offs.\n\n\"Their fans are probably the loudest, most passionate group I've come across,\" said Itoje.\n\n\"Big games are always different,\" added the reigning European Player of the Year. \"There is always an extra edge and everyone is a bit sharper and more switched on during the week. There is more of a build-up, a bit more anxiety in the lead-up to the game.\n\n\"It's going to be special. Clermont are a top side. We are going to prepare unbelievably well.

Everything was completely different about Sunday's game at Emirates Stadium, and it summed up where both teams are at right now.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'Monreal thinks he's at a christening!' Tunnel antics annoy Neville\n\nIt was a match between the teams in fifth and sixth place in the Premier League but it felt more like it was ninth versus 10th, in one of those dead rubbers you get at the end of the season.\n\nYes, Arsenal won, to end United's long unbeaten run, but nobody really cared - including United manager Jose Mourinho.\n\nIt was the first time Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has beaten him in a competitive game, at the 16th attempt and after 13 years of trying.\n\nBut watching Mourinho afterwards, it was probably the first time in about six months that I have seen him relaxed and smiling.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Mourinho 'proud' of players despite defeat\n\nIt was a game that was clearly a nuisance for him, sandwiched between the two legs of United's Europa League semi-final against Celta Vigo that he has made it obvious is his priority.\n\nSo, for United, Sunday was just a case of survival - to get off that pitch without getting any more injuries - or at least that was how it looked.\n\nArsenal were clearly short of confidence, and in a different way they were looking to survive the game too.\n\nThey eventually worked out that United were not at full strength and they might be able to win, but for most of the first half they looked nervous, as if they were thinking 'let's not lose and have more fans protests after the game'.\n\nThe Gunners might have got the three points but the way they did it did not make any sort of statement about how strong they are.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Wenger pleased with 'patient' Arsenal\n\nThe game matched the build-up - completely flat\n\nWhen I played for United against Arsenal, I always thought I was going into a situation that was totally out of my comfort zone.\n\nIt was a matter of life and death, or it felt like it anyway.\n\nThis time, Mourinho had been telling us for the past 10 days that his priority was the Celta Vigo tie.\n\nThat completely knocked the stuffing out of the build-up and the game matched it - it was completely flat.\n\nI was watching it with former Arsenal defender Martin Keown in the Match of the Day 2 production office, and he agreed that the lack of atmosphere and intensity was the most disappointing thing.\n\nArsenal defender Martin Keown clashed with Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy in 'the battle of Old Trafford' in September 2003\n\nEven in the tunnel beforehand you saw everyone hugging and smiling, which would never have happened when Martin and I played.\n\nOur teams were at each other's throats most of the time - literally on a few occasions.\n\nThere is a famous picture of me being throttled by Arsenal defender Lauren in September 2003 - in 'the battle of Old Trafford' - while a few weeks earlier in the Community Shield at the Millennium Stadium I was booked after only 27 seconds for a tackle on Patrick Vieira.\n\nNeville was shown a yellow card inside the first minute of the 2003 Community Shield and Arsenal defender Ashley Cole joined him in the book seconds later, for a foul on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Gunners striker Francis Jeffers was sent off late in the game for kicking out at Neville\n\nSunday was a million miles away from that kind of occasion. I tweeted during the game that it was like a testimonial, and it was certainly played at that kind of pace - which is what you would expect from a pre-season friendly between two Premier League teams played in the United States.\n\nIt felt like a veterans game but if Martin and I were playing each other now, there would have been more sparks flying than there were at the Emirates.\n\nMourinho got his priorities right this time\n\nMarcus Rashford scored the winner in the first leg of United's Europa League semi-final against Celta Vigo - the return is at Old Trafford on Thursday\n\nUnited's eggs are all in one basket now - for them, making the Champions League is all about winning the Europa League.\n\nIt makes sense in lots of ways because, as well as looking like the easier route, it gets you straight into the group stage and you avoid starting the season early in the qualifying rounds, which you have to do if you finish fourth.\n\nIf they do win the Europa League, then I think Mourinho has had a brilliant season. If not, then that is when the criticism will probably come his way.\n\nThe pressure is on them for Thursday, when Celta Vigo come to Old Trafford, and it is a dangerous game to play, but I think Mourinho did the right thing with his team selection against the Gunners.\n\nSome of the players he rested conserved energy and the ones who came back from injury have got some playing time under their belts, which bolsters the squad a little bit.\n\nThat sort of performance would not be acceptable from United in normal circumstances, and in general they need to improve when they go away to the top clubs.\n\nLooking at their performances in their 0-0 draws at Liverpool in October and at Manchester City last month, they did not offer enough of an attacking threat.\n\nI think United fans will expect far more in those games from the start of next season, especially because by then it will really be Mourinho's team.\n\nA big job ahead for Arsenal's manager\n\nArsenal have put themselves back in touch with the top four with Sunday's win but I don't think they will make it, from what I have seen of them recently.\n\nI think there is a big job in store for whoever is the Gunners' manager next season, and that is the key issue when you talk about their future.\n\nYou cannot assess who Arsenal will buy in the summer until you know who is going to be in charge - if it is, say, Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone then it will be 10 warriors; if Wenger is still manager it will be 10 really nice and pretty footballers.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Match of the Day 3: Who is going to make the top four?\n\nIn contrast, with United, you can predict that Mourinho is going to grab hold of that squad and say to his players that if they are not mentally tough enough, they will be out of the door.\n\nThree or four of the team that lost to Arsenal might not be at the club next season but you know there will be some big characters arriving in the dressing room.\n\nMourinho is building a team that he can go to war with, and it will not be long until these kind of games are back to being the big battles we all remember.\n\nPhil Neville was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T21:34:20.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/9CBE/production/_95962104_philnevilleandfrancisjeffers.jpg","class":"Sports","digest":"tvS5KRH6G9kw7040CNKR9w==\n"}

And is Brendan Rodgers actually better than Jurgen Klopp?\n\nWe try to answer those questions and take a look at some of the other interesting stats from the weekend.\n\nNorway? No way!\n\nArgentine Premier League players past and present had something to chirp about when Nicolas Otamendi scored for Manchester City in Saturday's 5-0 win over Crystal Palace.\n\nThe 29-year-old scored the 400th goal by an Argentine in the competition. By contrast, Brazilians have only supplied 322. If only Diego Costa had not chosen Spain, eh?\n\nBut where do Argentina rank in the 'Table of nations to have scored goals in the Premier League, not including UK and Ireland'?\n\nEighth. A lowly eighth.\n\nHere are your top five:\n\nYes, Norwegians have scored more goals (507) in the English top flight than Argentines, Brazilians, Italians (407) and Belgians (434).\n\nForward Ole Gunnar Solskjaer weighed in with a hefty 92 goals during his time with Manchester United. Ex-Chelsea striker Tore Andre Flo, John Carew (Aston Villa and Stoke) and Bournemouth striker Joshua King have added to the tally, and are among the 36 Norwegians to have scored since the competition began in the 1992-93 season.\n\n'You're not yet bad enough for this club, Ryan'\n\nIt's behind you Ryan, and heading towards goal...\n\nHe is a Stoke City stalwart. He has put his body on the line for the club he has captained for more than nine years. Ryan Shawcross is a true braveheart of a defender.\n\nSo what do we do? We see where he ranks in the all-time Premier League own-goals charts. Harsh, but necessary for this piece.\n\nThe 29-year-old scored an 81st-minute own goal and Bournemouth's second in Saturday's 2-2 draw to join a group of players who have found their own net on five occasions in the Premier League. That list includes former England internationals Phil Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Neil Ruddock.\n\nHe will need to ramp up the mishaps to dislodge the king of the own goals.\n\nPremier League all-time own-goal kings Richard Dunne (Everton, Man City \u0026 Aston Villa) 10 Martin Skrtel (Liverpool) 7 Jamie Carragher (Liverpool) 7 Frank Sinclair (Chelsea \u0026 Leicester) 6 Wes Brown (Man Utd \u0026 Sunderland) 6 Phil Jagielka (Sheff Utd \u0026 Everton) 6\n\nWest Brom remember how to score\n\nIs that a goal for West Brom? Or just a mirage?\n\nSalomon Wrong-don? Hal Robson-Kan-u-score?\n\nThe Baggies must have been wondering when their goal drought was going to end. They arrived at Turf Moor having gone five league games without finding the net.\n\nBut after 530 minutes of not hearing the sound of synthetic leather against their opponents' polypropylene nets, Salomon Rondon ended the barren run in the second half of Saturday's 2-2 draw against Burnley.\n\nBut the pain felt by Baggies fans is nothing compared to what the supporters of these clubs experienced:\n\nTeam Games without a goal Crystal Palace (1994-95 season) 9 Derby County (2007-08) 7 Ipswich Town (1994-95) 7 Sunderland (2016-17) 7\n\nEverton fans have on two occasions seen their side go six league games without a goal (1994-95 and 2005-06).\n\nHome discomforts\n\nMick McCarthy led Sunderland to no points in his first five home games at the Stadium of Light - no mean feat\n\nIt appears it will be all's well that ends well having avoided a comedy of errors for Craig Shakespeare since he took the hot seat at Leicester. Apologies.\n\nOn Saturday, he became only the fourth manager to win his first five home Premier League games as the Foxes beat Watford 3-0. The champions had the ignominy of being labelled 'relegation-threatened' until the former assistant came in and changed their fortunes.\n\nHowever, he lags behind home-win expert Manuel Pellegrini, who won his first 11 games at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium.\n\nBut which managers have the worst record?\n\nStep forward, or back, Chris Ramsey (QPR, 2014-15), Mick McCarthy (Sunderland, 2002-03) and Terry Connor (Wolves, 2011-12) - all three failed to win a single point in their first five home games. Their sides were relegated that season - which was more costly than a pound of flesh.\n\nAnd finally...\n\n\"I am NOT worse than Rodgers!\"\n\nBefore Sunday's game against Southampton, current Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and ex-boss Brendan Rodgers had identical Premier League records after their first 65 games in charge of the Reds: W33 D18 L14 (117 points).\n\nWe know Klopp drew his 66th game against Southampton.\n\nHow did Brendan do?\n\nHe won his.","author":"BBC Sport","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T20:50:04.000Z"},"source":"bbc-sport","urlToImage":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/4BD8/production/_95961491_rodgers_getty.jpg","class":"Sports","digest":"HouVnLA0VtdsrfNoe0mkaQ==\n"}

His investments transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile maker into a conglomerate with insurance companies, manufacturers, retailers, utilities and a railroad, as well as an equity portfolio valued at $135 billion.\n\nWith thousands of adoring fans watching live (and many more streaming video online), Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger took questions for five hours from the audience, analysts and journalists on topics from investing to public policy.\n\nBuffett, 86, said the Republican health plan that cleared the House of Representatives was sure to help the wealthy, and the billionaire reiterated his view that society needs to do more to help people he called “ roadkill” because they get left behind by capitalism. The Berkshire CEO also took another swing at hedge funds.\n\nMost of all, the billionaire expounded on his company and investments. Buffett said Wells Fargo \u0026 Co. mishandled its response to a fake-account scandal. And he predicted that Berkshire could make “a fair amount” on its recent airline investments if carriers keep a stronger grip on fares, while acknowledging “it is no cinch.”\n\nApple, IBM\n\nFor years, Buffett and Munger have told investors that the company’s size would be an anchor dragging down performance, only to defy their own predictions. But some missteps are now underscoring their warning.\n\nBuffett recently scaled back an investment in International Business Machines Corp. and said that he was too optimistic about the company’s prospects in 2011. Berkshire has been piling into Apple Inc. in its latest technology bet.\n\nThe moves prompted a broader discussion about whether Berkshire had dropped the ball in a sector that’s come to dominate the ranks of the world’s largest businesses. For most of his career, Buffett avoided technology stocks, saying the companies were outside his expertise. On Saturday, however, he issued a mea culpa for being too late to spot their potential.\n\nCompanies like Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. don’t require the large sums of capital that were required to sustain the giant industrial firms of an earlier era, Buffett said.\n\nIn hindsight, he said he could have been quicker to spot Google’s potential. Berkshire’s auto insurer Geico was an early customer of the search-engine firm, and its founders consulted him around the time they were taking the company public.\n\n‘I Blew It’\n\n“I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.”\n\nBuffett said his analysis on Apple differed from IBM, in part because the iPhone maker is more of a consumer-products company. Munger said the Apple investment was a good sign.\n\n“Either you’ve gone crazy or you’re learning,” the vice chairman told Buffett. “I prefer the learning explanation.”\n\nSteve Wallman, a money manager based in Middleton, Wisconsin, who’s been attending the meetings for more than three decades, said the remarks illustrated how Buffett and Munger are “fallible, thoughtful, and aware of how much the world has changed.”\n\nThey went through “a litany of trends they missed, mistakes they made,” Wallman said. “I’ve never seen them exhibit so much vulnerability.”\n\n‘Foot to the Floor’\n\nBuffett also expressed frustration on the acquisition front, saying Berkshire hasn’t put its “foot to the floor on anything for, really, a very long time.” The comment prompted an exchange with Munger, who said he thought Berkshire could now entertain deals up to $150 billion.\n\nThat would represent a giant leap for the conglomerate. Its largest buyout was the 2010 purchase of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for about $34 billion.\n\nIt’s not for a lack of trying. Buffett said Saturday that Berkshire and 3G Capital were each prepared to put $15 billion into a bid by their Kraft Heinz Co. for Unilever this year. The offer was pulled after the consumer-goods giant rejected the proposal.\n\nDavid Rolfe, who manages about $6.8 billion including Berkshire shares at Wedgewood Partners, said he wasn’t surprised that Buffett is bummed out by the growing cash pile. Stock markets have been rising for years, making it harder to find attractive investments.\n\n‘Cash Problem’\n\n“A run-of-the-mill bear market could certainly solve the cash problem” by offering opportunities for Buffett, Rolfe said.\n\nBerkshire gained 2.4 percent this year, trailing the 7.2 percent advance of the S\u0026P 500 Index. Buffett’s company said after markets closed Friday that first-quarter operating profit slipped 4.8 percent to $3.56 billion, as insurance units faced claims from a cyclone in Australia.\n\nThe stream of earnings is a growing challenge. The company’s next CEO may have to allocate far more capital than Buffett ever did, the billionaire said Saturday. That will involve deciding how much to deploy to Berkshire subsidiaries, takeovers and stock picks while also considering whether to return funds to shareholders.\n\nBuffett, who hasn’t publicly identified a successor, doesn’t pay a dividend and rarely repurchases stock, arguing that he can do better by retaining earnings. But investors pressed him about whether the record cash pile would force him to rethink his approach.\n\n“At a point, the burden of proof really shifts to us, big time,’’ Buffett said. “There’s no way I can come back here three years from now and tell you that we hold $150 billion or so in cash.’’\n\nWatch Next: Berkshire After Buffett","author":"Noah Buhayar","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T22:55:20.253Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/igd8GEpYnaPg/v0/1200x800.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"xzdX/PrEIIyAcDQE+xJIBw==\n"}

But political risk hasn’t gone away. Here’s a look at the other major elections coming up over the next 18 months.\n\nMay 9\n\nSouth Korean Presidential Election\n\nMoon Jae-in prepares for a televised presidential debate in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nWho is competing?\n\nFormer opposition leader Moon Jae-in faces software tycoon Ahn Cheol-soo in the race to succeed conservative Park Geun-hye. She was ousted amid a corruption scandal entangling some of South Korea’s most powerful conglomerates. Hong Joon-pyo, who’s backed by the latest iteration of Park’s party, is also running.\n\nWhat do the polls show?\n\nRestrictions are now in place on the reporting of polling specifics. The most prominent candidates are Moon and Ahn.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nThe result could shape the international response to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Moon has signaled a softer touch to relations with Kim Jong Un, while Ahn has backed the installation of a controversial U.S. missile shield. Both have endorsed measures to reduce the influence of South Korea’s family-owned “chaebol” conglomerates.\n\nMay 14\n\nGerman Regional Elections in North-Rhine Westphalia\n\nWho is competing?\n\nThe incumbent Social Democrat-led coalition will face off against Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. The SPD is in coalition with the Green Party. The Free Democrats, a traditional CDU ally, are also a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWhat do the polls show?\n\nThe rust belt state is traditionally an SPD stronghold but polls suggest the CDU is closing the gap. With the Greens polling poorly and the Free Democrats on around 12 percent, there is a chance Merkel’s party could enter the coalition government or even take the state.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nThe outcome will give a clear sense of voters’ mood four months out from September’s federal election. With nearly 18 million people, North-Rhine Westphalia accounts for more than a fifth of Germany’s population.\n\nMay 19\n\nIranian Presidential Election\n\nHassan Rouhani supporters during a campaign rally in Tehran on May 4. Photographer: Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWho is competing?\n\nThe incumbent moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, is seeking a second term. Conservative Tehran mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi are his leading challengers in the six-man race. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, is thought to favor Raisi.\n\nWhat do the polls show?\n\nThere are no reliable polls in Iran. A survey published this week by state-affiliate Iranian Students Polling Agency showed Rouhani leading Raisi by 53 percent to 32 percent in a head-to-head race. Against Qalibaf, Rouhani was ahead by 49 percent to 38 percent. The remainder of those questioned wouldn’t back either candidate or refused to respond.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nThe election is a referendum on Rouhani, who struck a deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. His main opponents say they would respect the deal, but the election of a hardline president still raises the risks of a showdown with U.S. President Donald Trump, who described it as a “disaster.” A conservative could also be more hostile to foreign investors.\n\nSept. 24\n\nGerman Federal Election\n\nAngela Merkel Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg\n\nWho is competing?\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel, in office for 12 years, is seeking a fourth term. Her main challenger is Social Democrat Martin Schulz, a former European Parliament president. A record four other parties — the Left, Greens, Free Democratic Party and the Alternative for Germany — also are poised to win parliamentary seats.\n\nWhat do the polls show?\n\nMerkel’s bloc of Christian Democrats and Bavaria’s ruling CSU party lead the Social Democrats in all polls, though Schulz’s campaign hasn’t hit full gear yet. Possible coalitions could include an SPD-Green-Left alliance and a CDU/CSU-FDP-Green combination. Polls say the biggest share of voters prefers a rerun of Merkel’s “grand coalition” with the SPD.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nMerkel is the most powerful European leader of modern times and sets the tone on everything from fiscal policy to the EU’s stance on Russia. Schulz is a pillar of the political establishment, so a victory for him would see more continuity than change. But a defeat for Merkel would see Germany — and Europe — lose her clout and experience on global affairs.\n\nLikely this year\n\nMalaysia General Election\n\nNajib Razak Photographer: Mohd Rasfan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWho is competing?\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak’s Barisan Nasional coalition is seeking to extend 60 years of uninterrupted rule. It’s up against a group of opposition parties that have been fractured by infighting and have competed against each other in some smaller elections. The opposition has no central leader, and the main Islamic opposition party has shown interest in backing Najib on some policies.\n\nWhat do the polls show?\n\nNationwide polls haven’t been published. While an opposition research outfit says support has fallen among ethnic Malays for Najib’s United Malays National Organisation, many analysts see his coalition retaining power — possibly with an increased majority.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nNajib is seeking to put behind him a political funding scandal that has tainted much of his second term as leader. A stronger mandate will help him push reforms to move Malaysia closer to becoming a developed nation and improve its finances. Renewed political instability could deter foreign funds from investing and keep companies from increasing capital expenditure.\n\nBy late May 2018\n\nItalian General Election\n\nWho is competing?\n\nEx-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is likely to run for the Democratic Party of current premier Paolo Gentiloni. He would probably face Luigi Di Maio, vice-president of the lower house, from the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Other candidates are expected to include Matteo Salvini, of the anti-immigrant Northern League.\n\nWhat do the polls show?\n\nSurveys show the Five Star Movement is neck-and-neck with the Democratic Party. An Ixe poll on May 5 showed both tied at 28 percent. The Northern League was on 13 percent, and the Forza Italia party of ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi had 12 percent. Who will win, and the make-up of any coalition, depends in part on electoral reform due in coming months.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nDi Maio’s Five Star has called for a referendum on Italy’s euro membership, but has no clear plan on how to replace the single currency. It will also decide the political fate of Renzi, a politician who wants to clean up the banking system, boost investment and speed up the judiciary to help revive an economy that has barely grown since the launch of the euro.\n\nJuly 2018\n\nMexico Presidential Election\n\nAndres Manuel Lopez Obrador Photographer: Dania Maxwell/Bloomberg\n\nWho is competing?\n\nTwo-time presidential candidate and radical populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will likely face Margarita Zavala of the National Action Party, wife of former President Felipe Calderon. Miguel Angel Osorio Chong is the candidate for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. The candidacies have yet to become official and the field may change.\n\nWhat do the polls show?\n\nLopez Obrador, who is from the Morena party, is the leading contender in most opinion polls, followed closely by Zavala. Osorio Chong is a distant third.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nMexico’s energy sector and Nafta overhaul. Lopez Obrador has said he’d seek to legally overturn the country’s landmark energy reform if he’s elected, and his combative style may make Nafta re-negotiations with the Trump administration far more divisive, increasing risks of a breakdown in talks.\n\nOctober 2018\n\nBrazil Presidential Election\n\nWho is competing?\n\nThe field is wide open. President Michel Temer says he won’t run and traditional party loyalties have collapsed, meaning a myriad of candidates could compete. Nobody has officially launched a candidacy yet, but former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he may stage a comeback.\n\nWhat do the polls show?\n\nLula leads current opinion polls, with around 30 percent of voter intention, followed by Marina Silva, an environmental activist turned politician, and Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right legislator known for homophobic and sexist remarks. Sao Paulo Mayor Joao Doria, an entrepreneur and reality TV star, has been one of the politicians who gained most traction in some of the country’s largest cities.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nThe political stability of Latin America’s largest economy and the durability of its economic recovery. Wide-spread disillusionment after a severe recession could bring to power an outsider or populist unable to build consensus in Congress and unwilling to adhere to fiscal discipline. The uncertainty over the election is already dampening investor and consumer confidence.\n\nNov. 6, 2018\n\nU.S. congressional elections\n\nU.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg\n\nWho is competing?\n\nEvery one of the 435 House seats will be up for election, along with a third of the 100 senators. On the Senate side, that includes a few vulnerable Republicans like Dean Heller of Nevada, as well a number of Democrats running in states that President Donald Trump won, including Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n\nWhat do the polls show?\n\nIt’s early. Trump’s low poll ratings are giving Democrats hopes of picking up seats in both chambers, but the electoral map is challenging for them.\n\nGet the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nDemocrats would love to win control of at least one chamber of Congress to have better leverage to counter Trump’s agenda and gain leverage over future Supreme Court nominations. On the Senate side, more Democratic-held seats are up for re-election, making it a challenge for them to pick up the three seats needed to take over the chamber. Republicans have a firmer lock on the House, but are almost certain to lose some seats.\n\n—With assistance from Shamim Adam, Brendan Scott, John Follain, Vivianne Rodrigues, Rosalind Mathieson, Nacha Cattan, Kevin Whitelaw and Raymond Colitt.","author":"John Fraher, Alan Crawford","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T04:01:05.556Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iZiXKUBKaphM/v0/1200x803.jpg","class":"Media","digest":"Dt36tzDP27rIhFi9Lb1FtQ==\n"}

He said he’s confident the global oil market will soon rebalance and return to a “healthy state.”\n\nSurging U.S. production has raised concern the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners are failing to reduce an oversupply and prop up prices. Oil has surrendered all its gains since their deal late last year to cut output and with OPEC meeting in Vienna later this month, several nations have said they’d support an extension of the 6-month agreement that began in January. This is the first time the Saudi minister has suggested it could be extended beyond 2017.\n\n“Based on the consultations I have had with participating members I am rather confident the agreement will be extended into the second half of the year and possibly beyond,” Al-Falih said. “The producer coalition is determined to do whatever it takes to achieve our target of bringing stock levels back to the five-year average.”\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.2 percent to $46.76 a barrel by 12:20 p.m. Singapore time on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the benchmark for more than half the world’s oil, was up 1.3 percent to $49.73 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Both are still more than 50 percent below their peaks in 2014, when the U.S. shale boom exacerbated a market glut and triggered the biggest price crash in a generation.\n\nAl-Falih said last month that OPEC and its partners have failed, after three months of limiting output, to achieve their target of reducing oil inventories below the five-year historical average. Group member United Arab Emirates said earlier in May that the producer group should extend the collective production cuts into the second half of the year when an expected upturn in demand will help to re-balance the crude market.\n\nVienna Meeting\n\nRussia, which is not member of OPEC but is part of the deal, also thinks it will be necessary to extend the reduction deal, according to Energy Minister Alexander Novak. The producers agreed last year to curb output by as much as 1.8 million barrels a day starting January. OPEC will meet in Vienna on May 25 to decide whether to prolong the deal beyond June.\n\nWhile the producers curbed supply, production in the U.S., which is not part of the agreement, has risen to the highest level since August 2015 as drillers pump more from shale fields. But American crude inventories are showing some signs of shrinking, falling for the past four weeks from record levels at the end of March.\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nDespite lingering headwinds, the oil market is improving from early last year when markets were at a low, Al-Falih said.

They’ll also have to have to show that their research spending amounts to at least 10 percent of their global sales, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is still private.\n\nPhRMA’s membership includes industry giants such as Eli Lilly \u0026 Co. and Pfizer Inc., as well as smaller companies that don’t have the same research pedigree. The thresholds are a high bar for some companies whose businesses have focused more on buying older drugs and raising their prices, and for smaller companies that don’t yet have drugs on the market.\n\nThe review began earlier this year after one of PhRMA’s then members, Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, said it would charge $89,000 a year for a drug that was being imported from overseas for about $1,000. The company had done limited new research to get the drug approved in the U.S. The drug is used to treat a rare and deadly pediatric condition.\n\nMarathon Out\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nSoon after Marathon announced the price for its drug, Steve Ubl, chief executive officer of PhRMA, said Marathon’s “recent actions are not consistent with the mission of our organization.” Marathon left PhRMA last month ahead of the review, which the lobbying group’s board is scheduled to vote on Tuesday, according to the people familiar with the matter. The changes would be immediate, according to a third person familiar with the matter.\n\nAnother proposal in the new rules gets rid of a tiered membership within the trade group, one of the people said. While many large drug companies are full members, smaller companies have been able to join as “research associates” for lower fees. This category would be eliminated under the new guidelines.\n\nThe changes come as the White House sends mixed messages about its plans to address drug prices. President Donald Trump’s administration has said he wants to loosen regulations on almost all industries, though he has also accused drugmakers of “ getting away with murder” because of their pricing practices. He’s promised to take action to decrease drug costs.","author":"Cristin Flanagan","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T03:19:51.048Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ijpbuew.CfHA/v0/1200x801.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"KWKx9nbzwrurzgoUOxnTUA==\n"}

Managing Director Renyuan Gao and managed $139 million as of January. It’s part of a new crop of asset management firms that are expanding China’s reach on Wall Street as money has poured into the U.S. from the world’s second-biggest economy.\n\nChina’s marquee names are among those setting up shop in the U.S. Chen Feng, who controls the HNA Group airline and hotel conglomerate, has opened a U.S. money management firm. China Vanke Co., the mainland’s second-largest residential developer, has indirectly taken a major stake in a manager. All told, about 324 firms with financial ties to the mainland and Hong Kong had registered with regulators by last year, more than double the number in 2012, filings show.\n\nThey are riding the wave of capital that left China on concerns about bank debt, a real estate bubble and the yuan, which plummeted about 11 percent against the dollar in the last two years. The currency flight was reflected in balance of payments data where capital outflows tripled to $220 billion last year from $70 billion in 2014, according to Derek Scissors, a China economist at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n“There is so much Chinese money floating around the U.S. now,” Scissors said. “If you’re a Chinese money manager, why wouldn’t you come here?”\n\nRead more about the cause of the capital outflows from China\n\nThe migration comes amid a Chinese shopping spree for an array of U.S. companies, including financial firms like New York’s Cowen Group Inc. and the Chicago Stock Exchange. Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group led the purchase of the exchange, which was founded in 1882. The deal was reviewed by a U.S. panel on national security grounds and eventually cleared in December.\n\nIn another deal with political overtones, a subsidiary of Chen’s HNA Group agreed in January to buy a stake in Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital, a New York fund of hedge funds firm. The announcement came after reports that Scaramucci had been tapped for a top job in the White House, stirring speculation that HNA’s motives were partly political.\n\nScaramucci, whose White House job never materialized, has denied that HNA was seeking influence in the Trump administration.\n\nThe registration of the China-linked firms with the SEC hasn’t drawn such scrutiny. The SEC began requiring hedge funds and buyout firms to sign up with the agency in 2012 as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. About 30 percent of the Chinese firms that registered by 2016 are full-fledged money managers. The rest filed as exempt advisers that operate in the U.S. on a more limited basis.\n\n“It doesn’t require a lot to register in the U.S.,” said Michael McCormack, a financial marketing consultant who specializes in China’s asset management sector. “Especially when you compare it with the months or years it takes to get registered as a money manager in China.”\n\nSeveral of the firms, such as Vanke, have government ties or connections with state-owned enterprises. Some registered managers plan to invest in China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. Others say they will buy U.S. assets, such as real estate, or venture capital stakes in Silicon Valley startups.\n\nVanke Holdings USA formed Brightstone Capital Partners with several U.S. real estate experts to acquire commercial property. “We are definitely seeing a lot of opportunities,” said Kai Yan Lee, managing director of Vanke Holdings.\n\nChina’s biggest financial firms have their hands in several of the startups. Hong Kong’s ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management International, which is controlled by a joint venture between Credit Suisse AG and the state-run Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd., registered with the SEC last May. The asset manager, one of the largest in Hong Kong, plans to offer U.S. funds.\n\nCitic Capital Holdings, a money manager for one of China’s largest state investment companies, supplied $45 million to hedge fund CCSZF Management in Norwalk, Connecticut. ICBC provided financing in return for a cut of the profits. The fund makes leveraged bets on Treasuries through a relative value arbitrage strategy. Officials from ICBC Credit Suisse and ICBC didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nBillionaire’s Manager\n\nSome firms manage money primarily for moguls such as Cai, who has invested overseas for years and is worth $2.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He was married to Wu Yajun, who was the richest woman in China until the couple divorced in 2012.\n\nGao, Cai’s hedge fund manager, generated a 51 percent gain at Westfield in 2016, in part by betting on distressed corporate debt, according to an investor letter viewed by Bloomberg. Gao and a spokeswoman at Cai’s family office, Junson Capital, declined to comment.\n\nYour cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter.\n\nChen, whose conglomerate last year bought a stake in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., has also focused his U.S. firm, HNA Investment Management, partly on tourism. The firm reported assets totaling $78 million at the end of 2016, including a 19 percent stake in Red Lion Hotels Corp., a Spokane, Washington, hospitality and leisure company. HNA Investment officials didn’t return calls seeking comment.\n\n“Everyone is looking for ways of carrying cash across the border,” said Robert McTamaney, who formerly ran Goldman Sachs Asia’s securities division. “To the extent that domestic Chinese investors can invest” abroad, “the single largest consideration is an implicit short on the renminbi,” said McTamaney, who now runs Ripple Capital Management in New York.\n\nLimiting Outflows\n\nChinese citizens were able to circumvent government limits on overseas investing, including a $50,000 annual cap on foreign currency purchase, until last fall. Officials began to tighten enforcement of the restrictions in response to a decline in foreign reserves that reached $1 trillion by the end of 2016.\n\nThat prompted JD Wealth, which is majority owned by e-commerce giant JD.Com Inc., to shelve its plan to start a robo-adviser in the U.S. after registering with the SEC, according to a person familiar with the situation. Beijing-based JD Wealth had planned to allow Chinese citizens to open brokerage accounts with as little as $100 and invest in U.S. stocks through their mobile phones.\n\nOther Chinese firms are raising funds in the U.S. following the government crackdown. XIO Cayman Ltd., an offshore affiliate of XIO Group, a London-based private equity firm controlled by Chinese money manager Athene Li, registered with the SEC in November. XIO Group had earlier raised about $120 million from investors in the U.S. and overseas, according to a notice filed with the SEC on Sept. 6.\n\nThe next day, XIO completed its $1.1 billion acquisition of California-based J.D. Power and Associates from S\u0026P Global. Alyssa LaCorte, an XIO spokeswoman, declined to comment.\n\n“The tide has completely turned for almost every Chinese financial firm that is trying to grow an international practice,” said McCormack, the consultant, referring to the stricter enforcement of currency rules. “The clampdown is 99 percent of the reason for raising assets abroad.”","author":"Miles Weiss","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T22:00:00.001Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ilx5cNycKwm4/v0/1200x869.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"nOdYlt6uVqwsLcQWUbeS2Q==\n"}

She can hold a basic conversation and wake you up in the morning by turning on the lights. Hikari will message you at work and greet you when you return home. She'll also set you back about $2,700.\n\nMinori Takechi interacts with the Gatebox character. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg\n\nWhile Amazon.com Inc. and Google are barreling ahead with efforts to get voice-operated speaker assistants into consumers' homes, Takechi says these products are too focused on delivering utility. Instead, his Tokyo-based startup is betting that people will want to forge an emotional relationship with a digital assistant.\n\n\"My vision is a world where people can share their daily lives with their favorite fictional characters,\" Takechi, 29, said. \"We live in a time when all kinds of robots start making their way into our homes. But much of what you see now is inorganic and mechanical and I doubt people will want to communicate with something like that.\"\n\nHikari lives in a coffee maker-sized glass cylinder called Gatebox, as a hologram-like projection on a screen. She doesn't mind flirting. Say that you like her and Hikari will chirp back with \"today, tomorrow and the day after!\"\n\nIn its current form, Gatebox's appeal may be limited to Japan, which has earned a (somewhat over-hyped) reputation for being a place where unmarried men would rather develop a relationship with a virtual girlfriend. The good news is that the company plans to offer a variety of avatars, which could be anything from cartoon characters to sports heroes.\n\nAzuma Hikari, the first character for the Gatebox virtual home robot. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg\n\nVinclu isn't the only company betting that emotion will have to be a key ingredient for a robotic or AI companion. Groove X Inc., another Japanese startup, is working on a robot that \"touches your heart.\"\n\nWhen Takechi set out to raise money in early 2015, before Amazon's Echo started to gain traction and Google Home debuted, most investors weren’t keen on backing a hardware project, he said. Still, he was able to raise an initial 20 million yen ($180,000) based on conceptual sketches. One early fan was Taizo Son, the younger brother of SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son.\n\nSo far, Vinclu has raised about 200 million yen from investors including Primal Capital and Incubate Fund. Line Corp., Japan's biggest instant messaging company, bought a majority stake in the startup in March as part of its push into AI.\n\n\"Combining Gatebox know-how and technology with our own Clova AI platform will allow us to develop a new kind of post-display, post-touch agent capable of making the lives of the users richer and more fun,\" said Jun Masuda, Line's chief strategy and marketing officer. The company is planning to launch its own tabletop speaker called Wave in early summer.\n\nGatebox is still a long way from offering real companionship, and its repertoire is limited to just a handful of scripted interactions. But Line's backing will give Takechi access to richer AI capabilities and an ecosystem of services that go far beyond messaging. More than 171 million subscribers in Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia use Line to read the news, hail taxi rides and find part-time jobs.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world.

Although Amazon’s Echo and Apple’s Siri give the impression they can answer anything, in reality that kind of general AI is still years away, according to Benedict Evans, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. He warned in March that there's a limit to how many voice commands people can memorize and that some may end up having negative emotional responses to things that seem almost human, but aren't quite.\n\nMinori Takechi. Photographer: Ko Sasaki/Bloomberg\n\nVinclu's answer to the limitations of voice is kawaii, the Japanese word for cute. Takechi said the company is developing behavior patterns that will let their characters make mistakes without getting on your nerves. The bet is that when a virtual girlfriend fails to order an Uber, you're more likely to forgive her than a disembodied voice from a cylinder.\n\nTakechi's formative experience was in the sub-Saharan nation of Malawi, where he moved at the age of 10 when his mother got a job helping the government fight malaria. Stuck in a town with one traffic light and a school where no one spoke his language, Takechi spent the two years holed up in his room with only Pokemon characters for company. That gave him an understanding of otaku culture and planted the seed for Gatebox, he said.\n\n\"The kind of communication we are focusing on isn't your typical command-answer relationship,\" Takechi said. \"Kawaii is infallible.\"\n\nFor more on the technology that powers AI assistants, check out the Decrypted podcast:","author":"Pavel Alpeyev","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T21:00:12.360Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/inKk5Vc.8iaA/v0/1200x793.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"m2G/IVJ78GGBtJgqap9pJQ==\n"}

Kennedy Profile In Courage Award on May 7.\n\nBoston (AP) -- Former President Barack Obama, in his first public comments about the ongoing debate over his signature health care plan, implored members of Congress on Sunday to demonstrate political courage even if it goes against their party's positions.\n\nObama briefly returned to the spotlight as he accepted the annual John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award at JFK's presidential library in Boston. The award is named for a 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Kennedy that profiled eight U.S. senators who risked their careers by taking principled though unpopular positions.\n\nIn his approximately 30-minute speech after accepting the award, Obama steered clear of partisan attacks and never mentioned his successor, President Donald Trump, who has often criticized the previous administration and has worked to undo many of Obama's initiatives, including the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe former president recalled members of Congress who voted to pass the ACA during his presidency, only to lose their seat in later elections.\n\n\"They had a chance to insure millions,\" he said. \"But this vote could also cost them their seats, perhaps end their political careers.\"\n\nObama made no direct reference to Thursday's House vote to dismantle much of the health care law, but declared that while it did not take courage to help the rich and powerful, it does require courage to help the sick and vulnerable.\n\n\"It is my fervent hope and the hope of millions ... such courage is still possible, that today's members of Congress regardless of party are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth, even when it contradicts party positions,\" said Obama, whose appeal seemed to focus on wavering Republicans.\n\nArizona Sen. Jeff Flake, one of the few Republicans to attend the dinner, told reporters the Senate would write its own version of the legislation and he did not expect the House bill to survive intact.\n\nThe former president focused much of his address on the legacy of President Kennedy, as the library prepared to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth later this month. Obama noted the Kennedys had long advocated for health care reform, and in particular, the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died of brain cancer before passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAmong the guests who made their way down the red carpet into the library for the event were representatives of the Kennedy family, members of Congress, former Obama staffers and celebrities including former late-night talk show host David Letterman. Former Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State John Kerry also were in attendance.\n\nU.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Obama earned the award by meeting many challenges that faced him during his presidency.\n\n\"It's about understanding the challenges we face as a country and as a planet and mustering the political will to do what is right even if what is right at that moment isn't necessarily popular,\" said Kennedy, a harsh critic of the GOP health overhaul plan.\n\nCaroline Kennedy, JFK's daughter who served as Ambassador to Japan, and Jack Schlossberg, Kennedy's grandson, presented the award.\n\nSchlossberg, 24, and planning to attend Harvard Law School, said Obama inspired him the way an earlier generation was inspired by his grandfather.\n\n\"Without Barack Obama, I might still be sitting on my couch, eating Doritos and watching sports,\" he said.\n\nWhile the former president has steered away from any involvement in U.S. affairs during his early months out of office, he forayed into the French political debate last week by posting a message of endorsement for centrist presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, who defeated his far right rival Marine Le Pen in Sunday's election.\n\nOn Monday, Obama travels to Italy to give a keynote address on climate change and food security at Tuesday's Seeds and Chips Global Food Innovation Summit in Milan.","author":"","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T03:07:48.147Z"},"source":"bloomberg","urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i_Uu9BOLIwXE/v0/1200x805.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"2NhviGSsjmttbZL6YPXRXA==\n"}

That's still close to the population of the U.S.\n\nThe category of men and women who've left their home for better economic futures in expanding urban centers have served as a major pillar of the labor force for more than two decades – without enjoying the same social services as urban residents. But this class is now shrinking, and stands at 60.1 percent of all “peasant workers” in 2016, down from 62.8 percent in 2011.\n\nWith the general working-age population declining, lower mobility by rural residents could boost wage gains, posing a competitiveness challenge.\n\nStill, the labor force is better equipped. More held college degrees or above than 2015 -- more than 9 percent -- and the age profile is shifting with almost a fifth now being over 50.\n\nAnd if there are fewer stories of teenagers from poor central regions traveling to a Shenzhen factory job, that's actually government policy.\n\nOfficials wary of unmanageable growth in key cities including Shanghai and Beijing have strictly capped the population while encouraging workers to move to smaller provincial hubs.\n\nConfirming this trend, even though there can be a huge gap between rural and urban wages, countryside pay is growing at a faster pace.\n\nHere's the lowdown on China's economic data\n\nWhile 52.9 percent of \"peasant workers\" had jobs in manufacturing and construction sectors, the usual destinations for most of them a decade ago, more are being employed in services: 46.7 percent had jobs in the tertiary sector, led by with wholesale, retail, residential services, hotel and catering. That’s up from 44.5 percent in the previous year.\n\nServices accounted for 56.5 percent of China’s economy in the first quarter.

Trump, who asked for Flynn's resignation after reports surfaced that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak, has said he was not aware that Flynn had discussed the issue of US sanctions with the Russian ambassador.\n\nAccording to CNN, however, Yates plans to insist that she warned the White House about Flynn's conversations with Kislyak and how he was misleading Pence, and was therefore susceptible to Russian blackmail.\n\nThen the vice president-elect, Pence had insisted in an interview with CBS that Flynn and Kislyak \"did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia\" — a statement that turned out to be untrue and set off alarm bells at the Justice Department.\n\nYates reportedly told White House Counsel Don McGahn that she had \"serious concerns\" about Flynn. But he was not asked to resign until February 13, at least two weeks after Yates visited the White House.\n\nInterest in Yates' testimony grew even more last month after The Washington Post reported that the White House had tried to prevent her from testifying publicly. The White House has denied the charge, but it is unclear how much Yates will be able to publicly disclose due to restrictions imposed by the presidential communications privilege.\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper will also testify before the subcommittee, which is chaired by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham — a Russia hawk who has said that Flynn's request for immunity in exchange for testifying before the congressional intelligence committees about his Russia ties is \"a bit bizarre.\"\n\n“He's said in the past nobody asks for immunity unless they have committed a crime.

But the whole situation is really strange,\" Graham told CNN last month.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee's top-ranking Republican and Democrat — Reps. Jason Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings — said in a joint press conference on April 25 that Flynn appeared to have broken the law by not disclosing payments he received from Russia in his 2016 security clearance application.\n\nAfter news broke of Flynn's conversations with Kislyak, some questioned whether he may have violated the Logan Act — a 200-year-old law that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign governments.\n\n“The bottom line is if there were any contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian intelligence services that were inappropriate, I want to find out about it, and I want the whole world to know about it,” Graham said.\n\nClapper, meanwhile, told MSNBC's Chuck Todd in early March that he had seen \"no evidence\" of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nClapper and Yates have also been invited to testify before the House Intelligence Committee about Russia's election interference in an open hearing sometime this month. The hearing was originally scheduled for late March but was scrapped by the committee's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes.\n\nNunes has since stepped aside from the committee's investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. He handed the probe over to Rep. Mike Conaway in early April amid questions about his ability to lead an unbiased investigation.","author":"Natasha Bertrand","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T03:52:12.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/590fab9b52b5d852008b4f46-1190-625/sally-yates-is-set-to-give-bombshell-testimony-about-michael-flynn-and-russia--heres-what-to-expect.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"yz7ZZZLbxfs0eHOufS40VA==\n"}

Macron, a 39-year-old pro-business centrist, defeated Marine Le Pen, a far-right nationalist who called for France to exit the European Union, by a margin of 65.1 % to 34.9%, according to the French Interior Ministry. A former investment banker, Macron served for two years under President François Hollande as Minister of Economy, Industry, and Digital Data, but had never held elected office. He only truly entered the public discourse when he rebelled against Hollande's socialist party and ran as an independent presidential candidate for his En Marche! (Onwards!) movement. Now, he will become the youngest president in France's history. Here's what you need to know: View As: One Page Slides\n\nThe beginning Emmanuel Macron was born on December 21, 1977, in Amiens, a city in northern France. He is the eldest child of Jean-Michel Macron and Françoise Macron-Nogues and only family member not to have pursued a career in medicine. His dad was a neurologist at the University Hospital of Amiens, while his mother was a paediatrician. His younger brother and sister also kept to the family tradition to become a cardiologist and nephrologist, respectively. Macron, on the other hand, has had a fairly non-linear career path. In high school, Macron studied sciences, before going on to take philosophy at Nanterre university. The apprentice philosopher then left Nanterre to head to the Institute of Political Science (Sciences Po), before studying at the \"École nationale d'administration (ENA),\" two of the most prestigious French schools. After studying, he became a financial investment banker at Rotschild \u0026 Cie., which he left in 2012, before becoming deputy secretary-general at the Elysée. He then served in François Hollande's cabinet as economy minister.\n\nAn unconventional romance In 2007, Macron married his former high-school French teacher Brigitte Trogneux, who is 24 years his senior. They met at the private, catholic school La Providence in Amiens. At the time, he was 15 years old. Brigitte Trogneux was, according to the IB Times, charmed by young Macron's intelligence and once stated: \"Emmanuel's skills are totally above average. You can say I say this because we're married, but this is the teacher speaking.\" During a speech at their wedding, Macron thanked family and friends for \"accepting\" and \"supporting\" the couple throughout the years.\n\nThe start of a political career Macron was asked by Hollande to replace Arnaud Montebourg as Minister of Economy, Industry, and Digital Data in 2014. Macron's predecessor was considered a protectionist, and his most famous campaign was probably \"Made in France,\" where he pushed individuals to buy French products over foreign goods. Macron on the other hand, is pro-businesses, pro-EU, and even urged American scientists, academics, and entrepreneurs, who feel uneasy about President Donald Trump's administration, to move to France. Montebourg was essentially sacked because he was outspoken about government cuts. A threat the Hollande government averted by ousting Montebourg from his position.\n\nReforming France's economy Macron was tasked with reforming France's economy after zero growth for the past three years. One of Macron's biggest accomplishments as a minister under Hollande is his eponymous pro-business \"Loi Macron.\" He wrote it to steer the socialist government towards more business-friendly policies and wrote it with Prime Minister Manuel Valls. This was the first law he tried to pass as economy minister and it was extremely unpopular with the French population as well as Parliament. Many believed that it went against the socialist values of France. The law was actually so unpopular with both the National Assembly and Senate that it had to be passed by invoking article 49, which made it a question of confidence in Parliament. The law was a solution to shake up an economy drowning in rules and regulations as well as boost growth. Interestingly, there was no mention of the 35-hour-week working limit, which Macron is extremely vocal about as he says it constrains business.\n\nDifficult relationship with Hollande It's no secret that Macron and Hollande have a difficult relationship. The French saying \"I love you, me either\" comes in mind, when attempting to describe it. Macron was Hollande's mentee. They met in 2006 through a friend, and reports state that they got along well. In March 2015, Macron was asked in a radio interview with Europe 1 whether he wanted François Hollande to be president again. Macron stated that he was loyal to Hollande and the president of France was the \"legitimate\" candidate. A year later, he launched his movement \"En Marche!\" which roughly translates as \"forward.\" Francois Hollande said of his protégé: \"he needs to be in the team, under my authority.\" \"En Marche!\" Although Macron served in a socialist government, he is standing for presidency as an independent, socially liberal, and pro-business centrist candidate. This is seen by many as a rebellion. On April 6, 2016, the political novice, who had never stood for any kind of election, announced in his hometown of Amiens the launch of his party. He resigned from government four months later.\n\nAn unknown candidate At the beginning of November 2016, he announced his candidacy for the highest office in the country. At the time, Macron was unknown to most French people. Starting a movement from scratch, as an unknown candidate, without any experience of how to campaign for a municipal election let alone for the presidency, is a fairly unconventional move in French politics. He has, however, managed to make a success out of it. Macron's website claims that there are 200,000 members of \"En Marche!\" although he recently stated in an interview with Quotidien his movement had 220,000 members. Those numbers are difficult to verify, however.\n\nA change of image for France Macron paints himself as a maverick and anti-establishment, which could serve him well. Like Trump, Macron has been successful in part because he is seen as not being part of the political elite. He positions himself at the centre of the political spectrum, trying to woo moderates from both the left, and the right. This proved advantageous in a year where all other candidates were the extreme versions of their own parties.\n\nThe other presidential candidates Benoît Hamon, for example, is a radical in the social party who advocated for a 32-hour work week. Even François Fillon, the presidential candidate in the Republican party eventually brought down by a string of scandals, seduced Front National voters as he is a proud Catholic and champions old-fashioned family values. And then there is Front National's Le Pen, a divisive figure linked to anti-immigrant policies and whose father was convicted of racism several times. Despite her success in the first round, Le Pen was unable to mobilise a majority of the French behind her in the second round.\n\nControversies on the road to victory Macron's road to victory was not easy. On March 14, 2017, a probe was launched into a CES event in Las Vegas where Macron was the main speaker. Organised while Macron was in charge of the Minister of Economy, it is alleged that public relations giant Havas was awarded a major contract to organise the event without competition. The candidate's aide stated that \"the story isn't about Macron,\" however.\n\nTies to Hillary Clinton His reported close ties to US presidential candidate Hilary Clinton are not popular in certain corners of the French press, while there are also allegations he used public funds to finance his own presidential campaign. Earlier in February, a top aide of Macron's also accused Russia of hacking attempts and spreading fake information about him in Kremlin-backed news outlets. He claimed that this was due to Macron's pro-EU stance.\n\nMacron's emails leaked online Then, on Friday, May 5, less than two days before the second round of voting, Macron's campaign was the target of a massive computer hack. Around nine gigabytes of data, including contracts, emails, and accounting documents, were shared by an anonymous user online and began spreading on social media. Macron's campaign was able to issue a statement just minutes before a midnight blackout went into effect, preventing officials from commenting on the hack.\n\nA landslide win Despite the last-minute leak, Macron defeated Le Pen by a margin of 65.1 % to 34.9%, according to the French Interior Ministry. Macron's expected margin of victory was bigger than the gap shown by pre-election polls, which had projected a Macron victory by around 20 points. His victory will serve as a relief to European allies who had feared another populist result after Britain's vote to exit the European Union and Donald Trump's ascension to US president last year.","author":"Andree Gorman, Business Insider UK","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T20:43:18.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/590f8713dd089526608b4571-1190-625/meet-emmanuel-macron-the-39-year-old-former-investment-banker-who-will-be-the-next-french-president.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"+8Gxt4r/SUnHS/SSEwU/LQ==\n"}

The plan, instead, is cruelty.","title":"The GOP's passage of Trumpcare is one of the cruelest things the party has ever done","url":"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/05/the_gop_s_passage_of_trumpcare_is_one_of_the_cruelest_things_the_party_has.html","text":"Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Republican Party won control of government promising help. Help for the unemployed, help for the uninsured; help for the struggling, help for the anxious. But help isn't on its agenda. The plan, instead, is cruelty.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate’s chief political correspondent.\n\nIt’s how we get the American Health Care Act, a profoundly nasty bill whose callousness is just barely matched by its shoddy, haphazard construction.* Here is what the AHCA, deemed “Trumpcare,” would do if signed into law: Allow states to waive coverage for “essential health benefits” like hospitalization, maternity care, and mental health coverage; allow discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions like asthma, cancer, and other ailments without a safety net for Americans priced out of the individual market; allow employers to hollow out health benefits for their employees, threatening health insurance for the millions of Americans who receive it through their jobs; remove funding that helps give care to children in special education classes; and not least, it would cut Medicaid spending and end the Medicaid expansion, taking $880 billion from the program.\n\nThe AHCA isn’t a health care bill as much as it is a vehicle for upward redistribution, taking from the bottom to give to the very top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nUnder the original AHCA, 24 million people would lose insurance by the end of the decade, relative to the status quo. We don’t have an outlook for this latest, and final, version from the House; desperate to pass the bill and avoid further scrutiny, House Republicans have ignored the Congressional Budget Office and kept the text of the bill from public view. But when you’ve ended protections for pre-existing conditions and destabilized individual and group markets, it’s a virtual guarantee that even more Americans will lose health insurance on top of those 24 million.\n\nThat’s millions of low-income Americans, unable to pay for basic—but often life-saving—care. That’s millions of American women, ineligible for health insurance because they were once pregnant, or abused, or raped. That’s addicts, many in communities that voted for Donald Trump and back Republican lawmakers, who can’t purchase or afford insurance because of their addiction. That’s someone struggling with mental health issues, now deemed a high risk for insurers. That’s countless Americans who, through chance or fate, live with injuries and disorders and diseases that will leave them uninsurable without the protections of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGet Slate in your inbox.\n\nAll of this is being done not to improve the American health care system or deliver better (or cheaper) care—as House Speaker Paul Ryan continuously and falsely insists—but to cut taxes on the richest taxpayers. The AHCA, in other words, isn’t a health care bill as much as it is a vehicle for upward redistribution, taking from the bottom to give to the very top.\n\nOn Thursday, House Republicans passed this bill, 217 to 214, marking their triumph with applause and celebration. In their minds, they’re fulfilling their promise to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, delivering on nearly a decade of rhetoric. It’s unclear if the Senate will even consider this specific proposal, much less vote on it. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already said that his chamber will wait on a score from the Congressional Budget Office, an early sign, perhaps, that Senate Republicans have little interest in assisting their House counterparts. (Some Senate Republicans have also already indicated that they will be working on their own bill, but who knows how much of the House version will ultimately be incorporated.) In the meantime, President Trump celebrated the House vote with a ceremony in the Rose Garden, praising a bill that trashes every promise he made during his campaign, that harms millions for the sake of a wealthy few. “This is a great plan, I actually think it will get even better,” Trump said, before stating outright what passage of the bill was actually about—fulfilling a campaign promise. “Make no mistake, this is a repeal and replace of Obamacare.” Whatever comes next, we can still now pass judgement on House Republicans. From its crafting and introduction to its passage, what we’ve witnessed from Ryan and his caucus is an incredible contempt for process, truth, and their own constituents. Like the Affordable Care Act before it, the American Health Care Act reorganizes one-sixth of our economy. But unlike the ACA, which was signed after a year of public hearings and fierce debates, the AHCA was slapped together in secret with little regard for the consequences or knowledge of its effects. When pressed on its contents, lawmakers shrugged, content to vote in ignorance for a bill whose defining feature is, again, its profound cruelty. And when asked about this—when asked about the distance between their rhetoric and what we know about the proposal—Republicans simply lied. “We’re not taking a benefit away,” said Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to CNN on Thursday. “Nobody on Medicaid is going to be taken away.” This isn’t true. Little which Republican advocates have said about the bill has been true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIndeed, if there’s a single worst actor in this drama, it is Ryan, whose reputation for personal integrity and political competence have little basis in reality. Throughout, Ryan has misled and obfuscated, spinning the AHCA as a net benefit for Americans, when it’s anything but. And he’s done this in service of his central agenda: tax cuts and the evisceration of a safety net he once blasted as a “hammock” that lulls Americans to “dependence.” Most Americans oppose this rhetoric, which is why Ryan and his party have to lie to sell their program of slashing insurance for the poor to fund tax cuts for the rich.\n\nRyan and his singular drive are emblematic of the party he leads. The GOP is well in the grip of an ideological mania, committed to a rigid and hierarchical vision of America, where help comes only to those who deserve it, and where the “deserving” are a small, select group, chosen by the market, or defined by their inherited wealth and privilege. If the American Health Care Act is a callous and destructive bill, it’s because it come from a party that’s made cruelty its cardinal virtue.","author":"Jamelle Bouie, Slate","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T19:38:00.000Z"},"source":"business-insider","urlToImage":"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/58c86bbc6ff801da008b4d1a-1190-625/the-gops-passage-of-trumpcare-is-one-of-the-cruelest-things-the-party-has-ever-done.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"+jkC7z4Hui/QRMEmQdQgMA==\n"}

When grandma walked in: \"I was maybe 15 or so, and spending a week visiting my grandparents over summer break. I was in their office with my laptop and was doing the deed butt naked due to the A/C being broken that day. While in the heat of things my grandmother busts through the door to tell me that dinner is ready. I quickly tried to cover my junk/boner and nervously said I'd be out in a minute, while she just stood there staring. I guess she drew the conclusion that I was only naked because of the heat and apologized that it was so hot in the house, and that the repairman was going to be there shortly. “To this day I'm still not sure if she kindly said that to avoid the obvious awkwardness, or if she genuinely thought I was so hot that I was actually just lounging around their house naked. Either way, that dinner was very awkward, and I learned that masturbation was best left for the bedroom and during times when you were safe from interruptions.\" —ggk328\n\n2.

When I was 18, my mom decided to clean out my closet while I was at school and found the vibrator I kept in there. When I got home she didn't mention the vibrator, but gave me a lecture on how God hates masturbation and how to 'fight Satan's urge.' And probably the worst part was that I never saw that vibrator again. It was expensive!\" —joybwithu\n\n5. When this woman thought she was home alone: \"I live with my grandparents, and every Friday they always leave for the whole day.

Within a matter of hours the news spread amongst the entire boarding house and, the following day, the school.

I can tell you breakfasts have never been the same.\" —danielcruz1973\n\n11. When this guy who forgot to combat-lock the door: \"It was in 2003, right after we invaded Iraq. We convoyed from Kuwait to Baghdad. After stoping at our base and setting up, I was looking at our collection of dirty mags that had been sent from home. After getting myself all worked up I decided to handle some business. So, while in the back of our track vehicle, I started going to town but forgot to combat-lock the door. As I was about to finish the door swung open and my battle buddy stands there for a while, until he screamed after realizing what he saw. I didn't get a handshake for quite a while after that.\" —allend49300ec7b\n\n12. When this mom came home early: \"So one day I decided to try something a little different. I figured looking at some naughty stuff on a bigger screen would make for a better experience. So, I used the internet browser on the Wii in my living room to do just that, while my parents were out of the house. I was going at it fully naked, because why not? And then, suddenly, I heard footsteps on the porch, which, mind you, is about 15 feet away from where I was! My mom had come home quite a bit earlier than I expected. So I panicked, running to the door, still in the buff, trying to hold it closed, not even bothering to turn off the Wii because there was no time. But of course that failed. After a few moments of awkward silence, my mom told me to just go put my clothes on and come back to talk to her afterwards. It took me hours to get out of my room and face her again.\" —jaded4d3749abd\n\n13. When this woman's mother felt like giving some words of comfort: \"My mother was living with me at the time. It was very early in the morning, maybe 3 or 4 a.m. My mom was sleeping and I was down the hall in my own bedroom. I was full-on masturbating with a large, realistic dildo, just going to town on myself. I was trying to be quiet, muffling my oncoming orgasm into a pillow. Apparently my mother got up to go get a drink of water, which she NEVER does. As she passed my room, she heard the muffled noises, thought I was crying, and walked into my room, without knocking. I stopped immediately, but my mom came over and sat on the edge of my bed and attempted to comfort me while I lay there, denied what had been looking to be a very promising orgasm, WITH THE DILDO STILL INSIDE OF ME!!! I tried and tried to convince her that I had not been crying. But she wasn't buying it and sat there for half an hour giving me a motivational speech.\" —Gabrielle West, Facebook\n\n14. When this teen had a Fast Times at Ridgemont High moment: \"I had been staying at a friend's house for a few days when I was about 13. His older sister, who I had a huge crush on, walked in on me in the bathroom just as I was finishing myself in the shower. She got a full view as I came and she left the bathroom. I was so embarrassed that I called my parents to come and get me pretending to be ill. I could never look her in the face again, but, thankfully, she never told anyone.\" —layton99\n\n15. When this woman forgot something in the bathroom: \"I had moved back into my parents' home after a semester of college. One day, after taking a bath, I heard my 7-year-old brother from the bathroom exclaim 'Whoa, it's pink! And it's squishy!' I had to tell him that my Rabbit vibrator that I had left behind was a back massager.\" —persephone10000\n\n16. When this guy's search history led to a whole other conversation: \"I look up gay porn on my phone and masturbate to it. One day, my mom viewed my phone's search history to look up at a website she once visited, and instead saw every time I had searched up gay porn. Maybe the worst way to come out of the closet?\" —tylerh4ea5c1d10\n\n17. When sextiming goes wrong: \"My boyfriend of three and half years had just moved away, and I had moved back in with my parents. We were trying to keep our sex life \"sexy\" by FaceTiming occasionally, and one time I was getting really into it, only to have my mom walk in and scream. My dad then proceeded to check on what my mom was screaming about. Safe to say I didn't leave my room for a day or two, and said boyfriend didn't come back to visit for a couple months.\" —ellyses3\n\n18. When this Grindr mishap happened: \"I hit up my white fuckboy from Grindr and ended up agreeing to stay the night with him since we had the place to ourselves. We fooled around for a bit, but we end up passing out. Fast-forward to the morning: I wake up alone, thinking he went to work. I start jerking off and enjoying myself, not insanely loud. Just as I'm about to come, I hear him walk by the door and in my incredibly unsexy, groggy, surprised voice, I mutter, 'Oh fuck.' After I do so, the door barges open and a tall Asian guy with glasses (clearly not my fuckbuddy) comes in swinging a golf club at me as I'm sprawled on this bed with cum shooting from my dick. I'm screaming, 'OH MY GOD.' Turns out the Asian guy was his roommate who knew my fuckbuddy had gone to work, but didn't know I had stayed the night, and because our campus area had a series of break-ins, he prepared himself thinking I was a burglar.\" —Gucio Marcin Jim Powęska, Facebook\n\nNote: Submissions have been edited for length and clarity.","author":"Brian Galindo","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T21:16:04.000Z"},"source":"buzzfeed","urlToImage":"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-05/5/15/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/18-hilariously-embarrassing-masturbation-horror-s-2-10010-1494012916-6_dblbig.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"/6TWOu+Tugh+CSzqpSUpuA==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5910146c522ffcfb9a9ac702"},"description":"The franchise has remained a cultural force for over a decade by reinventing itself. But has it swallowed its own tale?","title":"Have “The Real Housewives” Peaked?","url":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/pdominguez/has-the-real-housewives-peaked","text":"The Real Housewives of Atlanta reunion. From left: Cynthia Bailey, Kenya Moore, Kandi Burruss, Andy Cohen, Phaedra Parks, Porsha Williams, and Sheree Whitfield. Bravo / Getty Images ID: 10965443\n\nSince its debut — with The Real Housewives of Orange County in 2006 — Bravo’s Real Housewives franchise has become the kind of cultural phenomenon that is familiar even to those who don’t watch any of its many iterations. The shows’ theater of absurdity — mixing kitsch and melodrama with catfights and self-branding — now has a global reach, from Potomac to Bangkok. It’s gone from an avant-garde form of television to the lingua franca of cable, as myriad competitors with their own versions of the feuding-women framework have appeared, including Basketball Wives, Love \u0026 Hip-Hop, Mob Wives, and R\u0026B Divas. It has even turned into fodder for entire news websites, successful podcasts, and multiseason parody series — like the Real Husbands of Hollywood and The Hotwives of Orlando — that have developed their own followings.\n\nAs its influence expanded, the franchise has come to represent a kind of Mean Girls sensibility; to say that something is “like Housewives” means to reduce that thing — including major political issues — into supposedly frivolous feminine terms and calculated camp outrageousness. Even Housewives executive producer Andy Cohen noted that last year’s Trump-dominated presidential debates had turned into a Real Housewives reunion, implying that they had devolved into petty accusations and a reality TV spectacle. It’s telling that Cohen invoked the reunion, specifically — in which the castmates sit down in a talk-show setting after the final episode to revisit the season’s major storylines — to draw the comparison. In some ways, that aspect of the format has become most representative of the franchise’s sensationalism as well as its self-referentiality.\n\nBut the Housewives franchise wasn’t always defined by catfights and reunions. As it became, collectively, a major ratings success over the course of the last decade, the focus of each incarnation of the show shifted from telling stories about the cast members’ family dynamics and separate lives to center, instead, on the conflicts they have with one another. And the effect of the show itself on the cast’s lives and relationships started becoming a more central — and more evident — aspect of the drama.\n\nBy tracing the evolution and expansion of the program over time, a clearer picture emerges of how it developed into its captivating combination of fakeness and authenticity, calculation and improvisation, self-promotion and (self-)imposed vulnerability. It also explains how Housewives’ very success — as the franchise’s conventions became evident to both viewers and castmates — threatens that delicately choreographed balancing act.\n\nThe title card for Season 1 of The Real Housewives of Orange County shows a more casual side to the ladies than those for later seasons. Bravo ID: 10957524\n\nThe Real Housewives franchise is often presented as the immaculate conception of Andy Cohen, the Bravo producer turned talk-show host; his childhood love of soap operas and actor Susan Lucci influenced his sensibility, and this is frequently presented as leading directly to the program’s creation. But the show as we now know it — a mélange of lifestyles of upper (middle)-class porn, soap opera drama, and reality television theatrics — emerged as the result of an ongoing collaboration between the Bravo network, producers, and the women themselves.\n\nAn outside producer, Scott Dunlop, initially pitched the show to Bravo in 2005 as a behind-the-scenes look at the upper-middle-class self-importance of his own neighborhood in Orange County. He was a branding expert and entrepreneur, not a professional reality television producer, and his version, titled Behind the Gates — described by a Bravo executive as Curb Your Enthusiasm–esque — wasn’t framed from the women’s perspective.\n\nAndy Cohen in 2011. Bravo / Getty Images ID: 10957539\n\nInstead, it was about general class absurdity, not feminine spectacle, and the women’s husbands, as Dunlop recalled, played a more prominent role. It mostly focused on the family of Jeana Keough, a former Playboy Playmate who was now an Orange County realtor married to a pitcher for the Oakland A’s, and her interactions with her neighbor, insurance salesperson Vicki Gunvalson. But the pitch didn’t totally work for Cohen, who was then part of the network’s programming team. “The women weren’t going deeply into their emotions or being honest about what was happening with their friends,” he wrote in his memoir Most Talkative. With input from the network — and Cohen — the series started moving closer to its current iteration as a reality version of the SoCal soap opera Knots Landing. Other families were added and a Bravo executive came up with the kitschy “Real Housewives” title as an allusion to ABC’s then-popular scripted dramedy Desperate Housewives.\n\nStill, that first season of Orange County, which aired in 2006, is a far cry from the now-standard Housewives format. The opening credits featured men’s and women’s voices talking about living “behind the gates” while “7 million families live in gated communities” flashed onscreen, suggesting that viewers were about to watch an edifying documentary. In the show’s introductory vignettes, the women look like casual moms in jeans and blouses. They’re introduced through random phrases that they uttered throughout the season, which, unlike the current catchphrases, weren’t necessarily about the women themselves, but rather attempted to convey something about the community’s values (“I don’t wanna get old”; “He’s pretty much keeping me”; “85% of the women have had breast implants”).\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County Season 1 reunion episode without a host. Bravo ID: 10957544\n\nMost important, the storylines focused on showcasing the individual wives and their family dynamics, not emphasizing the interactions or fights among the cast. In the first season, for instance, Gunvalson attempts to balance her insurance business and her controlling instincts as a mother and wife to second husband Donn. Keough appears trapped in a loveless marriage. The show was full of scenes that captured the relationship between these white suburban mothers and their sons, who came off as infantilized and overly powerful. Most of the drama, in the beginning, was intra-family, not inter-Housewife.\n\nAnd the reunions, originally titled Real Housewives Confess: A Watch What Happens Special, weren’t the spectacle of cross-talking and counteraccusations that have become a trademark of the show. They were a low-key affair — initially without a host — in which the women came together to reflect on funny or embarrassing moments from the season. This emphasis on suburban women’s relationships with their husbands and children was soon sidelined in favor of the feud-centric reality television drama and campy glamour that would come to define the show.\n\nID: 10957256\n\nThat initial season of Orange County had an average of 646,000 viewers, which fell well below the numbers of the network’s other reality shows such as Project Runway. But its demographic skewed younger, and, seeking to exploit that potential, the network brought in veteran reality producer Doug Ross (Fear Factor, Big Brother, and Bravo’s own Boy Meets Boy) to take over the second season of Orange County.\n\nInitially, the show’s main aesthetic changed only slightly: The “Housewives Confess” segment moved to a talk-show setting, with Andy Cohen onscreen as the human face of a Bravo producer, quizzing the women about the season. “Who here will cop to plastic surgery?” Cohen asked sheepishly. “Do you think you’re spoiled?” he asked the sons and daughters of the cast, who were trotted out for an entire segment of the reunion to talk about their storylines.\n\nBut the “Housewives children” would never be heavily featured again — except in service of their parents’ storylines — and a reunion would never again be free of discord. By Season 4 — which aired in 2008 — a new cast member, Gretchen Rossi, a 30-year-old with pageant-queen style engaged to an older man dying of leukemia, joined the cast, and her unimpressed fellow Housewives Gunvalson and Tamra Barney (now Tamra Judge) questioned the authenticity of their relationship.\n\n“We don’t believe that Gretchen is dating this guy. We think he’s paying her to take care of him,” Barney says during one confessional. During a party at Barney’s house, she gets caught telling Gunvalson that they’re going to get Rossi “naked wasted,” presumably to embarrass her.\n\nBravo Tamra Barney and Vicki Gunvalson (left) conspire to get Gretchen Rossi (right) very drunk in Season 4. ID: 10957564\n\nThis “dinner party from hell” — as Cohen called it— and Rossi’s relationship became fodder for the reunion special at the end of the season. Cohen adroitly shifts from shady showman to earnest sentimentalist as he teases out the accusations against Rossi — including information about an ex-boyfriend not revealed on the show itself — while also confronting them with hilariously moralistic exhortations and asking questions that viewers emailed to Bravo.\n\n“Some of our viewers called you BFFs — and some of them called you mean girls!” Cohen intones.\n\nWhen Rossi claims Barney set her up, Barney snaps back, “You’re such a fucking victim.”\n\n“Jesus Christ, Tamra,” Keough mutters, seemingly shocked by both the cursing and the ugly turn the reunion had taken. But that shock symbolized how anachronistic she was to the new format. Unsurprisingly, Keough, whose major storyline was her relationship with her children and her separation from her husband, was on her way out that season — the first casualty of becoming “the boring one.” And by then the franchise — which had sprouted versions in New York, Atlanta, New Jersey, and Beverly Hills — was evolving into something different.\n\nReal Housewives of New Jersey cast member Teresa Giudice angrily tosses a table on the first-season finale. Bravo ID: 10957594\n\nThe Gretchen Rossi storyline symbolized the beginning of a new culture of “callout” feuds, prompted in part by the parties and events designed to promote interactions between the Housewives. The shows’ story arcs became games of telephone about what each woman had said about the other, and that information was recontextualized and further stoked through confessionals and forced meetups, with all of the (mis)information culminating in an explosion at the reunion.\n\nThat culture would also characterize the other franchise iterations that debuted from 2008 to 2010: New York, Atlanta, New Jersey, and Beverly Hills. Some of the most iconic moments of these new versions came from the reunions and “dinners from hell.” It was at the Atlanta reunion where NeNe Leakes loudly admonished Kim Zolciak to “Close your legs to married men!” while lunging at her across the couch. And it was at a dinner from hell where Teresa Giudice, from Real Housewives of New Jersey, performed the infamous table-raising scene in which she screams at castmate Danielle Staub: “Oh, you’re stripping! Prostitution whore! You were fucking engaged 19 times, you fucking stupid bitch!”\n\nThese changes worked: While the first season of Orange County didn’t even reach 1 million viewers, the first New Jersey season average was 2.55 million viewers. With Atlanta, Bravo first cracked the 2 million viewer mark among adults 18–49. As the show entered an era of consolidation — demonstrating its success across all the cities by 2008 — a different caliber of celebrities started signing up, like Kandi Burruss, a former member of girl group Xscape and writer of TLC hits like “No Scrubs,” who joined Atlanta for the second season. Kim and Kyle Richards, former child stars — and Paris Hilton’s aunts — joined Kelsey Grammer’s then-wife, Camille, for the 2010 debut of Beverly Hills.\n\nGrammer threw what became one of the franchise’s most memorable dinners, featuring an electric cigarette–smoking psychic (the inspiration for the show Medium) going “rogue” during her reading for castmate Kyle Richards, while Faye Resnick of O.J. Simpson fame (who Grammer infamously labeled “morally corrupt”) defended Richards. Unsurprisingly, Beverly Hills started out with nearly 2 million viewers.\n\nRamona Singer and husband Mario renew their vows in Season 3 of Real Housewives of New York. Bravo ID: 10957610\n\nBut it wasn’t just the fights that captivated viewers. With Beverly Hills and New York especially, the show entered the realm of socialites who sponsored charities, threw $60,000 birthday parties for their children, and meticulously planned dog funerals. That these kinds of events became the scene of the fights added to the show’s allure. An era of increasing glamour was inaugurated as the women appeared in their introductory vignettes fully made up, wearing elegant gowns, and spouting off flamboyant yet aspirational catchphrases. And as the castmates started to understand their roles as producers of storylines and self-branders, they became savvier about throwing on-brand parties, like Real Housewives of New York castmate Ramona Singer’s vow renewal party at the end of Season 3, designed to match her True Renewal skin care line.\n\nThis intertwining of commerce, identity, and performance is at the heart of the shows’ appeal. Skeptics of the franchise imagine that Housewives viewers believe they are watching the women’s real lives unfold in front of their eyes, but it would be more accurate to say that the pleasure or interest is actually in watching the women deal with the conventions of reality television. The behind-the-scenes machinations propping up these conventions were themselves being exposed in unsanctioned blogs and gossip sites like Radar Online throughout the season. (Eventually Bravo contractually obligated the women to keep blogs as well.) Viewers became active participants in figuring out some of the dramatic mysteries before the reunion even aired.\n\nBut it was two previously unknown castmates from Real Housewives of New York who first made these production issues most evident on the show itself: Jill Zarin and Bethenny Frankel.\n\nID: 10957261\n\nZarin and Frankel’s real-life friendship breakup, which exploded in the third-season New York reunion in 2010, created a new meta storyline, in the half-intentional way that always makes for the best reality television.\n\nJill Zarin (left) and Bethenny Frankel in friendlier days, 2008. Marion Curtis / StarPix / REX / Shutterstock ID: 10957617\n\nBy the third season of New York, Zarin and Frankel had a real falling-out based on Frankel’s growing fame after her diet book — promoted on the show — became a New York Times best-seller and Bravo offered her a spinoff program about her marriage. Zarin felt that Frankel no longer had time for her, and she decided to reveal her resentment on the show, ambushing Frankel in Season 3’s premiere, with an accusation that Frankel had ignored her husband’s cancer. The breakup prompted the other cast members to pick sides, and the storyline took over the rest of the season, including most of the reunion, which became the first three-parter of the franchise.\n\nThe brilliance of Housewives editing is that it makes the reunion appear as the moment of maximum catharsis, clarity, and authenticity — the moment when the curtain goes up and everything finally gets addressed. But the reunion is carefully timed: It’s filmed after the castmates have had enough time to see the episodes and watch how the other women have talked about them throughout the course of the season. Ultimately, it’s just a strategic recontextualization of arguments that never fully resolve; it sets up the anticipation of drama for the coming season.\n\nThe program’s production takes pains to make sure the fourth wall is never broken, never acknowledging that a reality television show is being filmed; the women, for example, can’t mention that they’re filming during their interactions or confessionals, and any production problems are explained as purely personal issues between the women.\n\nBut the third New York reunion turned into a back-and-forth of accusations from Frankel and Zarin about the production of the show. While other installments of the franchise had mentioned storylines, editing had only been acknowledged in order to defend the show’s basic presentation of truth. By contesting Jill Zarin’s framing of their relationship, Frankel acknowledged the series as a show on the reunion stage.\n\n“You know, I love you,” Zarin tells Frankel desperately at one point at the beginning of the reunion, “and if we were ever really friends I hope that there’s a future for us.”\n\nFrankel levels with Zarin after their falling-out on The Real Housewives of New York third-season reunion. Bravo ID: 10957645\n\nFrankel then launches into one of the most revelatory speeches in the history of Housewives reunions, capturing — and exposing — all the contradictions of artifice and emotion, fakeness and authenticity, friendship and self-branding that makes the franchise so captivating:\n\n“You, me, everybody: We’ve talked to producers, we’ve talked to friends, we all have so many things in our heads about what we’re going to say today and what’s going to happen. I’m just gonna lay it to you straight like I would tell a best friend, or God, or whoever I would tell,” Frankel says.\n\nShe then goes on to reframe Zarin forever in a rare monologue — seemingly one of the longest unedited ones in reunion history: “This show and this fame thing took you over: the glam, the hair and makeup. You used to be a nice girl from Long Island that was motherly and nurturing only … Things would happen for me — whether it was the Today show or the Kentucky Derby — the minute I would say something, before I even got to explain it, you’d be like ‘Why not me? Why can’t we do it?’ … You would go on some like rampage…”\n\nIn other words, the success of the show itself — and Frankel’s increasing popularity — started creating a wedge between them. And Frankel believed that Zarin, as a result, had decided to frame her as the season’s mean girl to imperil her wedding spinoff show. “The cameras went up and it was ‘Let me slay this girl,’” she continues. “You told people not to film with me — sabotage Bethenny’s show.”\n\nCohen asked for clarification.\n\n“Hold on,” he asks, “you were really in a fight?”\n\n“Right,” explains Zarin. “Before the season started.”\n\nFrankel’s producer-approved exposure of the way the show itself affected the relationships on it gave her one of the most unvarnished, “real” moments of any Housewives installment. If most of the other Housewives resorted to the cheap, gendered moralism of slut-shaming, Frankel appealed to a different kind of moralism: of authenticity, loyalty, and friendship. And by turning that melodrama into a battle about superficiality versus realness, Frankel’s persona as a tell-it-like-it-is straight shooter became more affirmed than ever.\n\nA scene from Bethenny Getting Married?.

ID: 10957665\n\nShe went on to get her own spinoffs — Bethenny Getting Married?, Bethenny Ever After — and her own talk show, and to create her own successful business and brand, in Skinnygirl. Zarin, on the other hand, went on to appear in the television movie Night of the Wild, about suburban housewives who get eaten by dogs. Their blowout remains the most game-changing friendship breakup in the history of Housewives, and Zarin’s image never recovered. She was fired after the following season, and Zarin’s onscreen reputation was frozen forever as a real-life soap opera villain.\n\nBut Frankel’s “realness,” which the program enabled, also made viewers savvier about the show’s behind-the-scenes goings-on. It was impossible to unsee or unhear everything that was revealed, and the network’s strategies — which were already being exposed on blogs and gossip sites — suddenly became clearer.\n\nID: 10957263\n\nIt is now more evident than ever that Housewives is a kind of Survivor set in the wilds of domesticity and charity events, as the women struggle to stay on brand while creating enough drama to remain on the show for another season. Arguably, the show’s massive success has created the elements for its own potential downfall. Because the franchise has become so popular and so ubiquitous, it’s becoming harder to find women — or, for that matter, viewers — who haven’t already figured out the show’s conventions.\n\n“Realism” in the Housewives often means that the audience is able to see the cast members in a different light than how they’re portraying themselves. But as both viewers and castmates become more knowledgeable about how a “bad” or especially revealing edit is created, it becomes harder for the franchise to be surprising. Bringing on new castmates who don’t already understand how the show works — particularly how producers and editors will frame them in ways — is one solution. But these new hires often have a “real” first season, and a savvier — or, for viewers, “fake” or boring — follow-up. Camille Grammer’s un-self-conscious attempt to take down Kyle Richards during the first season of Beverly Hills created a lot of “realism,” but the show never really reached those heights again, as Grammer — who described that first-season backlash as “brutal” — turned into what a castmate described on Howard Stern as “second-season Camille”: demure, proper, and the voice of reason.\n\nBut the problem the show faces is not just with finding compelling — and naïve — new cast members. Established series regulars, like Lisa Vanderpump and Kyle Richards on Beverly Hills and NeNe Leakes before she left Atlanta, appear to have reached such levels of entrenchment on their respective shows — and to have so much clout with Bravo — that they are able to keep their brands intact and not expose themselves to any of the vulnerability or drama that generates good storylines.\n\n\n\nLisa Rinna with veteran cast members Kyle Richards (far left), Lisa Vanderpump (left), and Andy Cohen on a reunion show for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Isabella Vosmikova/Bravo / NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images ID: 10957829\n\nA new era of “stunt” casting has become a different kind of solution for drawing viewers, as the franchise has resorted to hiring scripted TV television stars (like Facts of Life and Living Single star Kim Fields on Atlanta), soap opera stars (like Eileen Davidson and Lisa Rinna on Beverly Hills), and even — in the grand tradition of soap operas — reviving and bringing back old cast members (like Frankel’s return to New York after five years). While some castmates accused the show’s newer members of acting and not being authentic, the pleasure of watching these women really has nothing to do with their acting talent (or lack thereof). It is about seeing how they — often cluelessly — negotiate the show’s conventions.\n\nUpon Frankel’s much-touted return to New York, she openly refused to go through the motions of some of the show’s basic requirements. For example, she declined to meet new cast member Kristen Taekman after Taekman was upset that she wasn’t invited to Frankel’s birthday party. This is typically the type of issue that must get hashed out, because not being at events and missing out on the drama means a castmate can get fired, even midseason. Frankel yawned when another Housewife brought it up, explaining she didn’t even know Taekman, mocking the show’s conventions and its most obviously manufactured drama — on the show itself. If even Frankel was bored, then the audience was neutral, as her return didn’t particularly impact ratings either way.\n\nAnd just like Frankel, fans of the show are now completely familiar with its mechanics. Indeed, Housewives viewers are so savvy about the show’s aesthetic that Kyle Richards admitted that her Season 7 tagline, “I’m an expert in luxury — and I can always spot a fake,” was actually fan-generated.\n\n\n\nPorsha Williams grabs fellow castmate Kenya Moore by the hair during a reunion show for The Real Housewives of Atlanta. Bravo ID: 10957763\n\nIn an attempt to maintain relevance, the ever-evolving reunion has also become more self-referential: The “behind the scenes” of the reunion have actually become part of the show. It started with the last Real Housewives of Miami reunion in 2013, and with the infamous hair-dragging moment between Kenya Moore and Porsha Williams on Atlanta. The women are now shown arriving to the reunion, as well as during breaks as they strategize or calm down with their makeup artists. Further demonstrating the importance of maximizing the impact of the reunion, the current season of Real Housewives of Atlanta — the franchise’s highest-rated, which peaked at 4 million viewers — is ending its ninth season with a historic four-part, monthlong reunion. But despite all these ploys — from stunt casting to mega-reunions — ratings have been generally declining from their peak. The cultural juggernaut is starting to show signs that it might become a victim of its own success.\n\n\n\nID: 10957306\n\nIn a recent interview, Andy Cohen was asked about the possibility of a Real Housewives: All Stars spinoff; he noted that ratings are too strong to consider that, but added good-naturedly, “So when they really start petering out, we’ll just throw eight of them on an island.” The joke — suggesting an all-out embrace of reality television that would drop the façade of charity events for the metaphor of the jungle of Survivor — hints at the real anxieties and creative struggles that have emerged as the producers seek to subtly balance the competing demands of the castmates with potential viewer fatigue around clichéd storylines.\n\n\n\nAviva Drescher’s prosthetic leg lies on the floor at Le Cirque after being tossed during a heated exchange. Bravo ID: 10957809\n\nBut despite all the imitators, parodies, and recent attempts at maintaining relevance, the Housewives franchise continues to create the occasional surprise. There are still moments when class and gender, artifice and emotion all coalesce into the layered and outlandish aesthetic the show pioneered. This can take the form of a big explosion — such as New York’s Aviva Drescher sending her prosthetic leg flying across Le Cirque as a statement about authenticity — or a small, seconds-long reaction shot — like the one focusing on Lisa Rinna’s tears after Kim Richards returned a gifted stuffed bunny she deemed insincere.\n\nThese storylines and moments get dismissed as frivolous vignettes — indeed, the show is often critiqued as a “bad” representation of women — but other shows featuring unflattering portraits of men in serialized soap opera plots (like The Sopranos, Mad Men, and Breaking Bad) are routinely labeled “quality television.” Yet Housewives’ sincere respect for “lower,” “feminine” stories has reshaped the televisual landscape forever, redrawing lines that have traditionally divided low and high culture, soap opera, and reality television.\n\nAnd ensconced in the cable landscape it helped create, perhaps the franchise will end not with a reality TV bang, but in the same unassuming way it began: in a slow fade dictated less by any top-down directives or its creators’ wishes, and more by way of a gradual, bottom-up dismantling driven by the collective whim of ratings — the least sentimental reality of all. ●\n\nWant more of the best in cultural criticism, literary arts, and personal essays?

And Macron, who ran as an outsider despite establishment credentials, does bear some resemblance -- in his light political resume if nothing else -- to the neophyte leaders who have come from nowhere to shake up politics.\n\nThe French campaign trod what has become familiar ground in big Western elections over the last year. It saw the older, establishment politicians crushed as they failed to identify and adapt to waves of change. None of the traditional parties reached the run-off as voters in France, like elsewhere, soured on the same old choices.\n\nAs with the Brexit referendum and the US election last year, the election was fought on the fault line between well-off, cosmopolitan, urban elites and insurgents who tapped the frustrations of rural, less-educated and poorer voters, ones who are fixated on immigration policies and feel disenfranchised in a global economy that has hemorrhaged blue collar jobs.\n\nA fresh-faced candidate wins\n\nBut this time, the elite candidate -- albeit one whose youth and outlook suggested a break from older, more conventional political forces -- came out on top. In effect, Macron ran on insider ground while adopting the rhetoric and habits of an outsider.\n\nThe graduate of exclusive French schools who become a banker and finance minister formed his own party \"En Marche\" to escape the taint of the political establishment. His youth was a break from the past in itself. He will be the youngest French president ever and the youngest French leader, period, since Napoleon.\n\nThat sense of freshness could help break the somber mood that has settled over French politics for years -- though his inexperience will also test him.\n\nSuch attributes allowed him to separate himself from old-school politics and the establishment \"swamp\" in a way that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, with her decades at the center of Washington intrigue, failed to do last year.\n\nMacron's victory is likely to be studied by other centrist hopefuls in Europe and the United States as they struggle to combat the powerful economic message of candidates like Trump.\n\nJUST WATCHED What to know about Emmanuel Macron Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What to know about Emmanuel Macron 01:32\n\nHe will have to tackle the question of how to reach out to those who have given up on politics as usual and who find the promises of Trump and candidates like him so attractive.\n\nIn fact, Macron's enthusiastic support for the EU and globalization was an implicit rebuke to the instincts of Trump and those who successfully campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union.\n\nHe portrayed himself as a reformer, but as a bulwark against the forces of disruption dedicated to tearing down institutions rather than repairing them.\n\nBut he also took aim at the hidebound realities of French politics by warning of public spending cuts and more free market reforms designed to kick-start France's highly regulated economy.\n\nMacron's triumph will buck up establishment figures who have had little to cheer in recent months: He was endorsed by former President Barack Obama, who is seeing his own legacy dismantled by the populist Trump. Macron also carried the hopes of European elites like German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nTrump, however, had seemed to hint earlier in the race that he preferred Le Pen. The US President has struck similar themes to Le Pen on Islamic terrorism and immigration. And following a terrorist attack in Paris last month, he tweeted: \"Will have a big effect on presidential election!\"\n\nReinforcing the EU\n\nDespite the idiosyncrasies of the French race, many European analysts believe that Macron's win sent an unequivocal signal at an existential moment for EU unity.\n\n\"This is a victory of values, the values of the Enlightenment, the values of France, the values on which America was founded, the values from which the US and the UK have gone significantly astray,\" said Nicholas Dungan, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, who teaches at Sciences Po, a top international research university in France that counts Macron as among its most distinguished alumni.\n\n\"This is the end of know-nothing populism,\" he said.\n\nMacron's victory is already being seen as an invigorating boost for the European Union, which was knocked sideways by the British decision to exit and would have faced a meltdown had Le Pen, an avowed opponent of the European bloc, won.\n\n\"The French electorate clearly said after Brexit, against all the forecasts from the Dr. Dooms of this world, that they were against Frexit and against leaving the Eurozone,\" said Philippe Le Corre, a Brookings Institution visiting fellow, who is a former French Defense Ministry official.\n\nJust as Trump raged against Washington, Le Pen played into frustration with distant EU bureaucrats among blue collar voters, a tactic that proved potent for \"Leave\" campaigners in the British referendum.\n\nJUST WATCHED Macron addresses nation after election Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Macron addresses nation after election 02:05\n\nBut this time, the anti-establishment fury was not enough.\n\nIn dramatic scenes Sunday, Macron, whose supporters often waved EU flags alongside those of the French tricolor, marched to his victory rally at the Louvre in Paris to the strains of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" — which serves as the European anthem.\n\nIn many ways, the trauma of the UK's vote to leave Europe, which was warmly and repeatedly welcomed by Trump as a political achievement akin to his own shock election victory, appears to have concentrated the minds of French voters.\n\n\"The Brexit vote, you could even say, helped (Macron), because it helped France realize the importance of the European Union,\" said Dominic Thomas, head of the Department of French and Francophone Studies at UCLA, on CNN International.\n\nThere are some reasons to think that the populist wave has broken.\n\nLe Pen's defeat follows a showing of far-right leader Geert Wilders in the Dutch election in March that fell short of expectations. In local council elections across the Channel last week, meanwhile, the UK Independence Party, which campaigned for Brexit, was all but wiped out. A surge by a right-wing populist party in Germany, the AfD, appears to have peaked ahead of Merkel's re-election bid in the fall.\n\nYet it would be premature to dismiss populist, anti-establishment sentiments as a force in modern Western politics. For one thing, some establishment parties have adopted populist positions -- one reason why UKIP voters, for instance, are moving back towards the Conservative Party in Britain ahead of a general election in June.\n\nLe Pen splits France\n\nAnd after all, Le Pen managed to garner around 34% of the vote in the second round of an election which opened up deep splits in French society.\n\nStill, Macron's presidency may not count for much unless he is able to address the feelings of economic disenfranchisement and blight that have forced themselves to the fore in elections in the Western world over the last year.\n\nMacron signaled in his victory speech that he understood the stakes, asking his supporters not to boo Le Pen or her partisans.\n\n\"They expressed today anger, dismay and sometimes strong beliefs. I respect them but I will do everything over the next five years to make sure there is no reason at all to vote for extremes,\" Macron said.\n\nThe new French President will also have to consider how to frame his relations with the United States and Trump, whom he will now encounter at the G7 and NATO summits in Europe this month.\n\nPopulist influences in the White House, including political guru Steve Bannon, have been openly critical of the European Union.\n\nBut Trump played it straight down the line on Sunday, writing on Twitter: \"Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him!\"\n\nMacron, for all his philosophical, generational and temperamental differences with Trump, is likely to move carefully, stressing areas of agreement with the administration -- on fighting terrorism for instance.\n\nBut he is likely to be critical of Trump in places where the US and France differ, like climate change.","author":"Stephen Collinson, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T05:04:08.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170507180300-macron-win---1-super-tease.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"hMJi+4CuKFD5vfAYdiXT/w==\n"}

The 39-year-old centrist independent -- a former investment banker turned government minister who entered the presidential race without the backing of any established party -- garnered a solid footing through his pro-EU stance and promises to reform France's welfare and pension systems.\n\nBut there is no doubt that his win was also largely thanks to the traditional left, a group that had no candidate in the second round of voting. Many on the left voted for Macron out of fear of the other option: a country led by Le Pen and her xenophobic, anti-EU extremist National Front party.\n\nParisians dance and cheer at the Macron victory rally on Sunday night.\n\nAt the victory rally, Anas Ammounah, a 29-year-old Syrian refugee, said he was especially on-edge in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\nAlong with his wife and daughter, who were reunited in France six months ago, Ammounah waved the French flag as high as his smile was wide. He spoke of the generosity and kindness he received in the 18 months since he arrived in the country as a documented refugee -- and of the fear that it might be stripped away under a Le Pen government.\n\n\"We're here to celebrate a victory against Le Pen,\" he told CNN. \"We found that Le Pen would stop immigration and we were scared.\"\n\n\"We hope Macron will stop (Syrian President) Bashar, so we can return to our home,\" he added.\n\nAnas Ammounah, a Syrian refugee, attends the celebrations with his family in Paris on April 7th.\n\nReturning to their home in war-ravaged Aleppo remains a distant dream for Ammounah's family, so they basked in the bright lights of Macron's win in their new home in Paris. The win to them was a victory for France but also felt uniquely theirs.\n\nAs victory celebrations raged on into the late hours of Sunday night, a group of left-wing protesters clashed with police in a Northern Paris suburb.\n\nWhen asked about the protests, Macron supporter Pascal Bardin, 60, chalked it up as a typical reaction of young, left-wing political activists. He told CNN that the demonstrations didn't speak specifically to the fact that Macron won but reflected the French national pastime of protest.\n\n\"Whenever anyone is in power, they say 'degage' (French for 'Get Lost'),\" Bardin explained. \"Whenever anyone can't fix my life, 'degage.'\"\n\nMacron will face a daunting task in uniting a nearly obliterated traditional left (along with Macron's allies from the right) who voted for him simply in rejection of Le Pen.\n\nA woman walks past election campaign posters in Paris' 18th district on April 7. One poster, in yellow, encourages voters to vote against Marine Le Pen.\n\nAt his victory rally, Macron spoke to this fissure.\n\n\"I know the country is divided and this has led to people voting for extremes,\" Macron said during a speech at his team's headquarters Sunday night. \"I understand the anger, the anxiety, the doubt which many of you have expressed and it is my responsibility to hear that.\"\n\nEarlier in the evening, as the final polls rolled in, a crowd of residents of Paris' 15th district lined the streets around Macron's heavily-policed campaign headquarters.\n\nSabine Gruhier was one of them.\n\nThe 47-year-old Parisian tech-savvy start-up officer donned a red hat in commemoration of the lives lost in the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attacks as she waited to hear the results.\n\nGruhier told CNN that although Macron's win was \"surely the best option\" for her country, it was a shame that her fellow citizens were pushed to such a polarizing extreme that presented them to choose an option that didn't represent any of their political identities.\n\nSabine Gruhier, (L) of Paris' 15th district gathers with her neighbors on the street outside of Macron's headquarters moments before the polls closes on election day.\n\nAs Macron declared victory, Gruhier let out a sigh of relief, but vowed to remain politically vigilant throughout his candidacy. She called on Macron to investigate the spread of fake news online -- something she believes helped to fuel a grassroots spread of \"ignorance\" that led to Le Pen's rise in popularity.\n\n\"With this election I think people realized democracy is something fragile, and we have to keep fighting to protect it. Even if Macron won, we must still fight -- because the situation that Le Pen put us in was frightening.\"","author":"Kara Fox, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T06:11:59.000Z"},"source":"cnn","urlToImage":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170508052045-paris-elex-4-super-tease.jpg","class":"Sports","digest":"HquT94DaMh42+THvU8FSlw==\n"}

But through each phase, she has been his mentor and inspiration.\n\n\"Without her, I wouldn't be me,\" Macron, 39, declared after winning the first round of voting in April.\n\nMacron kisses his wife after winning the first round in April.\n\nTrogneaux -- now 64 with seven grandchildren -- will become France's next first lady. Unlike in the United States, the spouses of French leaders have traditionally held more negligible roles in public affairs.\n\nBut there is nothing traditional about Trogneaux, nor her presidential muse. Macron has said that if he is elected, he will likely give his wife an official role in his administration.\n\n'Love took everything in its path'\n\nTrogneux was born to a bourgeoisie family of chocolatiers, the youngest of six children. Like Macron, her hometown is Amiens in northern France.\n\nBefore she met Macron, she was on the path to living a relatively conventional life. She had a stable career teaching French literature, Latin and drama, and married a banker, Andre Louis Auziere, with whom she had three children.\n\n\"Love took everything in its path and led me to divorce. It was impossible to resist him,\" Trogneux told Paris Match magazine in 2016.\n\nShe divorced Auziere in 2006 and married Macron a year later, moving to Paris to work as a teacher.\n\nBefore she met Macron, Trogneux was on the path to a relatively conventional life.\n\nIn 2015 she gave up her career to focus on her husband, who was at the time the country's economy minister.\n\nIn a documentary by France3 TV , Trogneux is depicted as Macron's coach. In one scene, she guides him through a practice run of a speech, cutting in to tell him to lift his voice.\n\n\"Every night we debrief together and we repeat what we have heard about each other,\" she told Paris Match.\n\n\"I have to pay attention to everything, do the maximum to protect him.\"\n\nHer adult children, Sebastien, Laurence and Tiphaine, are reported to have a good relationship with their stepfather and have been seen campaigning for Macron in T-shirts bearing En Marche!, the name of Macron's party.\n\nTrogneux (C) with her daughters Tiphaine Auziere (R) and Laurence Auziere-Jourdan at a campaign meeting in Paris.\n\nIn fact, Macron made sure to get the blessing of Trogneux's children before proposing.\n\n\"It was a powerful act because not everyone would have taken that precaution, to come and ask us for her hand in marriage. I mean, it wasn't quite like that, but he did want to know if this was something we could accept,\" Tiphaine Auziere told BFMTV.\n\nCelebrating an atypical family\n\nIt's not clear when a serious romance began between the two, but Macron appeared to be a young man who knew what he wanted -- at 17, he professed his love for Trogneux.\n\n\"Whatever you do, I will marry you,\" he told her as he left Amiens to study elsewhere.\n\nBut Macron's parents didn't approve of their son's romance with Trogneux. His father told Trogneux to back off until his son was at least 18, Reuters reported , citing the book \"Emmanuel Macron: A perfect young man,\" by Anne Fulda.\n\n\"Nobody will ever know at what moment our story became a love story. That belongs to us. That is our secret,\" Trogneux was quoted as saying.\n\nPhilippe Besson, a friend of the couple, acknowledged that not everyone was so accepting of their relationship.\n\nJUST WATCHED How Emmanuel Macron won the French presidency Replay More Videos ...

Chuck and Axe are central to even the most tangential stories, their egos acting as a vacuum that brings everyone into their orbit. They are unrelenting in the pursuit of greatness and in their need to see the other fall. Much like last season’s finale, “Ball in Hand” pits Axe against Chuck, with an outcome that could change things for both men forever.\n\nAs the finale kicks off, Axe is blindsided by the news that he’s about to be arrested. Boyd shows up at his door, with more than his fair share of cockiness, and informs his former friend that he’s about to take a fall and that there’s nothing he can do about it. Boyd revels in the look of dismay on Axe’s face, but as always, Axe isn’t going down without a fight.\n\nWhile Dake and Chuck meets in a church to discuss how the prosecution will play out, with Dake trying to keep Chuck out of it and Chuck basically saying that a time will come when he finds his way into the case in an unofficial capacity, Axe is scrambling. He shows up at work and grabs his “burn bin,” which he uses to torch everything that belongs to him. He then meets with Wags and breaks the bad news, discussing the next steps. After realizing that he needs a CIO to replace him on the chance he is arrested, he orders Taylor to begin finding ways to liquidate some of their investments, even if he doesn’t tell them why he’s looking for such a game plan.\n\nAs Axe breaks the news to his people, Chuck must do the same. He meets with Ira and his father to confirm that Ice Juice didn’t get anyone sick, but rather Axe went after Chuck and used Ice Juice as his play. Ira quickly figures out the truth of it though: that Chuck used his friend and his father to lure Axe out into the open so he could snag him once and for all. Both Ira and Chuck Sr. are pissed off, but that doesn’t stop Chuck Sr. from signing an affidavit that says he went into his son’s trust without his knowledge. That keeps Chuck’s run for governor safe, even if it strains his relationship with his father.\n\nSpeaking of scrambling, Lara is doing some of her own. She hasn’t been the most compelling character this season, but her relative emotional distance with Axe has given her new life. She lets Axe know that she won’t run with the kids — this is his proverbial sword to fall on. That doesn’t mean she’s not hoping her husband will come home at the end of the day, but it does mean that for the first time in a while, she’s really looking out for herself. That’s depth we haven’t seen with Lara before.\n\nOne big question looms large over the first half of the episode: Will Axe actually be arrested, or will he find a way out of this like he has so many times before? That question is answered when Orrin meets with Dake to negotiate the terms of Axe’s arrest, hoping for something with no media and a chance for Axe to say goodbye to his wife. Dake is having none of it, saying he’ll take Axe when and where he pleases. As always, Darkest Timeline Sheldon Cooper means business.","author":"Kyle Fowle","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T06:15:19.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i1.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/billions_212_4804-r.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Regional News","digest":"GH6dkskTiDwqRKwSb1RYhw==\n"}

She finds herself at a classic brainwashing camp where everyone follows orders and they only wear white. It’s the Guilty Remnant, without the fun of smoking. It’s prison, with presumably better food. It’s hell, with better weather and less interesting companions.\n\nIn Megan’s room, the slogan “LIFE IS A LIVING THING” is printed boldly on the wall; vague, self-help-style platitudes like this appear throughout the facility. It’s basically one big SoulCycle studio, except the instructors are actual cult leaders, and the spinning bike you’re flailing on is your own sanity. Speaking of SoulCycle vibes, Kyle’s hair looks amazing this week. Seriously. I think he might be wearing an actual Bumpit. And I’m into it! But we’ll get back to him; let’s stay on Megan for now.\n\nDuring her first session at the facility, Megan is resistant, to put it mildly. Nina asks her to write her “Narrative Board” by listing “lies” in one column and “truths” in the other. Megan quietly takes a marker and, under “lies,” writes the words “Terence,” “IHM,” and “This place.” It’s the first time I remember experiencing a mild “yas queen” moment while watching Megan — and it won’t be the last — but Nina quickly pulls the rug out from underneath her, asking if Megan would rather do this with Kyle.\n\nObviously, the answer is yes, but when Nina goes so far as to open the door and call out, “Kyle, come in here,” Megan’s eyes widen: He’s here? He knows about this?! But Kyle doesn’t appear, and Nina lets the door shut, telling Megan, “Nobody is coming for you.” (That’s fine, Nina, but based on Megan’s expression right now, I think somebody might be coming for you.)\n\nTerence and Deann meet up with Connor (Megan’s extortionist) at a diner, where he’s disappointed to learn they haven’t brought the five million dollars he politely requested as hush money for the six-year sentence he served for killing Megan’s stepbrother Evan, which he did not do. (She did.) Instead, Terence offers Connor a more sensible payment plan. But when Connor refuses the counteroffer, Deann shoves him against the wall and tells him that if he doesn’t accept, “I will put you in the ground.” After that, Connor is more cooperative.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Megan spots another recruit being dragged out of a van and dropped off at the facility. This gives her an idea — and gives us The Arrangement’s most thrilling sequence to date: While the van driver isn’t looking, Megan runs outside, climbs in the back of his van, and hides. And just like that, she’s past the gate, away from the facility, and into the woods.\n\nThe driver gets out to pee, and Megan makes a run for it, successfully hiding in a tree when he attempts to chase her down and catch her. Once he’s given up, she runs some more — briefly followed by a drone — until she stumbles across a nice house in the woods, where a nice older woman takes her in and offers her a nice breakfast of tea and scrambled eggs. And if you think this all sounds a little too nice, you’re right: Megan soon spots a pillow embroidered with a familiar phrase: “LIFE IS A LIVING THING.” And once again, she’s running.","author":"Matt McConkey @mattmcconkey","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T03:01:54.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i2.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/the-arrangement-recap-050717.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"kIw04x+OimjL5fzbf5jaqQ==\n"}

In the season 1 finale of The Arrangement, she was kidnapped and taken to “the facility,” an undisclosed location where she was forced to wear bland clothing and was not allowed to leave until the Institute said she could. Their goal? To get her to work on herself. Sure, it might not sound bad, but the whole “you’re trapped and can’t leave” thing isn’t the best. And Megan’s whole ordeal is made even worse when she realizes Kyle’s in on it.\n\nHowever, by the time Megan leaves the facility, she appears to have embraced the Institute … at least until the finale’s final moments, in which she declares she’s taking on the Institute, and she’s ready to see that place burn.\n\nEW spoke with showrunner Jonathan Abrahams about the finale and what to expect in season 2.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: I have to say: I was very worried that Megan was on Team Institute, so that final moment was a huge sigh of relief.\n\nJONATHAN ABRAHAMS: We were all really excited for the moment. There was a lot of conversation between myself and Christine [Evangelista] and our director about how we want to play it. The network and the studio were also weighing in on: What does Megan post-facility look like? There were people who were like, “She looks exactly like Megan did before, she’s just saying yes to things.” Then there were other people who were like, “She’s total Stepford Wife.” I think where we landed and I think the right answer was somewhere in between all that, where you see that things have changed, but she can’t be a fembot. Kyle has to feel like the Megan that he fell in love with is still there. So it was really a fine line to walk.\n\nShe makes that final declaration against the Institute. What will that mean for her romantic relationship with Kyle?\n\nI think that it’s something that Megan’s going to have to face in season 2. Her feelings for Kyle are very, very mixed. I think that’s TBD. It’s not going to be an easy question to answer for Megan.\n\nIn creating this finale, was there a discussion of, how dark is too dark?\n\nThere was. The facility was in the season pitch in the beginning, so everybody knew. There was never any serious cautions from the network. They were always really supportive and encouraging of us going to a darker place. And I think everybody’s sort of fascinated by the dark side of these organizations that we’ve all heard about, so it was definitely easy to go there. In terms of Megan’s backstory, everybody knew about that in the beginning also. So going there I don’t think that there was a lot of trepidation. I think when it came to the facility, there was a question about: How much time can we spend there in a show that’s about L.A. and Hollywood? We had a lot of story to tell there and we wanted to make sure that we balanced it with some stuff that felt like the world that we’re used to as well.\n\nIf season 1 was a slow burn on Terence as the big bad, is he in full-blown big bad mode in season 2?\n\nTerence will be cooking meth at IHM, yes. [Laughs] The thing that’s important to me about Terence and IHM is that none of it is inherently evil. Terence is a narcissist and probably a megalomaniac and maybe even somewhat sociopathic, but regardless of that, he is a guy who created this self-help stuff not as a scam. He believed in it. He obviously gets a lot out of the recognition and the power that it gives him and he wants recognition and power in Hollywood and the rest of the world as well, and that’s a bit motivating factor and I think that sometimes it leads him to do questionable things. But in the beginning of [season 2], as far as Terence knows, he’s winning. He’s not going to be evil for the sake of being evil; he just wants to keep things in a place that he can manage. That’s always going to be his motivation. Now, the more active Megan gets to undermine him, then I’m sure that will bring out some of Terence’s lesser qualities, shall we say.\n\nIs season 2, then, upping the intensity even more?\n\nI feel like season 1 really sets the table for this story. People needed to figure each other out and figure out what the battle lines were, and we’ve slowly added to the thriller element of the show over the course of season 1. That energy is something we’re looking forward to continuing in season 2. Megan’s not going to be escaping from the facility every episode, but you have a better sense of what the danger is now than you did before.","author":"Samantha Highfill","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T03:01:52.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i1.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/arrangement21.jpg?crop=3px%2C34px%2C2700px%2C1419px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Sports","digest":"G1U6zRAk631/mK92ibd3hw==\n"}

Read at your own risk.\n\nShinwell paid the ultimate price in his quest to take down SBK during Sunday’s episode of Elementary.\n\nAfter beating up her partner, Shinwell Johnson (Nelsan Ellis) had the audacity to ask Joan (Lucy Liu) for help in getting an SBK lieutenant arrested so Shinwell could ascend in the ranks, thus bringing him closer to his ultimate mission of dismantling the gang. However, shortly after being promoted, Shinwell was found dead in his apartment.\n\nEW turned to executive producer Rob Doherty to get the scoop:\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Why kill Shinwell now?\n\nROB DOHERTY: We wanted an opportunity to watch his death wash over Sherlock and Joan. It affects them in very different ways. Each had a very different relationship with Shinwell as of his passing. So in the last two episodes of the season, it’s going to be a point of friction. Over the last 10 or so episodes, Shinwell’s been exposed, for better or worse, as someone with problems we can’t really solve or get past. It puts Sherlock and Joan in an interesting place as we get into the finale.\n\nPresumably, this is someone within SBK figuring out what Shinwell was ultimately trying to do. Are Joan and Sherlock now even more determined to take up his mission?\n\nYeah, they’re more motivated than ever to solve the problem that is SBK. They pickup Shinwell’s gauntlet and run with it. For Shinwell, it was his raison d’être, and Sherlock and Joan were willing to help as much as possible, even in the wake of the discovery that Shinwell himself was a killer. SBK always represented the greater evil and he would do virtually anything to see them undone. Shinwell’s death changes things. They lost their greatest wedge into that organization. In a lot of respects, Sherlock and Joan are starting from scratch as we get into the last two episodes.\n\nHow much does his death set them back in their quest to take down SBK?\n\nIt sets them back quite a bit. SBK recognized a problem in Shinwell and they took care of it the way they take care of lots of things. But at the same time, it gives Sherlock and Joan an opportunity and a motivation to put the group under a magnifying glass. At different times this year, they’ve left Shinwell to his own devices. They’ve trusted that between him, with the assistance of the gang unit, SBK will go away. So they’re knocked back emotionally and procedurally, but one thing they have to look at is a fresh crime. It’s tragic that Shinwell was killed, but it’s a fresh crime and it’s a new opportunity for Sherlock and Joan to attack the group.\n\nGoing into the finale, a gang war will erupt. What can you tease, because the logline seems to indicate that Joan and Watson discover that a familiar face is pulling the strings?\n\nYeah, I should clarify that somewhat. It’s a familiar face in that it’s someone we will meet in the penultimate episode. It is not, in fact, someone we’ve crossed paths or gone up against over the course of the season. So in the second to last episode, Sherlock and Joan will realize they’ve underestimated a certain shadowy member of the group. They’re going up against a very different kind of gang leader, to say the least.\n\nAre we finally going to meet the brains behind SBK?\n\nYeah, one of the things we really wanted to do is put a face to the gang. We’ve talked about SBK all year, but more often than not, it was in general terms. With Shinwell’s passing, it was absolutely time to look at the individuals that he was going up against. He said repeatedly that he’s one of the shot callers. It wouldn’t be enough to bring down a few lieutenants or a handful of soldiers, he wants the head of the snake. It would certainly appear, as of Sunday’s episode, that he got too close to someone that powerful. It is time for Sherlock and Joan to really swivel to gang itself and look for the same parties that Shinwell was trying to identify to bring down.\n\nElementary airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET on CBS.","author":"Natalie Abrams","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T03:00:02.000Z"},"source":"entertainment-weekly","urlToImage":"http://i1.wp.com/ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/elem_ep522_stills_050217_06.jpg?crop=3px%2C58px%2C2700px%2C1419px\u0026resize=1200%2C630\u0026ssl=1","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"tdB7K/2ck8fIt+TfQVWpgQ==\n"}

Greg Abbott made an unannounced appearance on Facebook live Sunday evening to sign a tough bill banning “sanctuary cities” in the state, thereby avoiding demonstrations opponents planned for later in the week when they thought he was going to put his signature on the legislation.\n\nWhile Abbott’s spokesman said he was just trying to reach a wide audience, critics called Abbott “cowardly” for springing the signing without notice.\n\nThough the bill, which cleared the Republican-controlled legislature last week, was opposed by most major police chiefs in Texas, Abbott said in a statement that the law was a blow against “those that seek to promote lawlessness in Texas.”\n\nAbbott also blasted the one law enforcement officer in Texas who appears to have adopted any sort of policy resembling the amorphous concept of a sanctuary city, Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez, who said she would not cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to hold immigrants while federal authorities investigate their status.\n\n“This law cracks down on policies like the Travis County sheriff who declared she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes,” Abbott said.\n\nIn fact, Hernandez does honor detainer requests from federal immigration authorities for inmates accused of serious offenses.\n\n[Texas governor poised to sign nation’s harshest anti-sanctuary bill]\n\nThe term sanctuary cities is ill-defined and takes different forms in different places. In general, jurisdictions identifying themselves as sanctuaries refuse to hold immigrants who have been arrested for local crimes past their release date so that Immigration and Customs Enforcement can take them into federal custody and try to deport them.\n\nThe Texas law would fine local governments up to $25,500 a day for policies that block immigration enforcement. Elected or appointed officials who refuse to cooperate with immigration agents could lose their jobs. Sheriffs and other police officers would face misdemeanor charges punishable by up to a year in jail and fines if they ignore requests to detain immigrants. The law would take effect Sept. 1.\n\nAbbott’s decision to sign the bill, which cleared the legislature last week, was no surprise. But holding the signing ceremony on a Facebook live stream was unprecedented, according to Texas media.\n\n“We’re going to where most people are getting their news nowadays and talking directly to them instead of speaking through a filter,” Abbott spokesman John Wittman said in a statement.\n\nThe governor’s communications director, Matt Hirsch, boasted on Twitter of having 101,000 views and “400,398 people reached” and “it’s only been an hour.”\n\n“I’m not sure all of that is positive,” someone wrote in response. “Coward,” wrote another. “Afraid of all the police chiefs who spoke out against the bill?” said a third.\n\n“Quite frankly I think it was a cowardly way to do it,” State Rep. César Blanco, a Democrat representing El Paso, said in an interview with The Washington Post. “I think he wanted to get it done quickly with less friction.”\n\nIt was unusual for the governor to skip the typical fanfare and ceremony surrounding the signing of a bill, and to sign it in a way that did not include the speaker of the house or the lieutenant governor.\n\n“This is red meat for his base,” Blanco said. “This for his primary voters, not for mainstream Texas.”\n\nImmigration advocates and some members of the media had expected the signing to come Monday or later, and opponents of the bill had been organizing rallies and protests around the expected public signing ceremony, said Texas state Rep. Victoria Neave, a Democrat and fierce opponent of the bill who fasted for four days last month in protest.\n\n“We anticipated it to be more public especially since this was one of his top priorities,” Neave said in an interview with The Post. “They expected him to be there and to be more public so people could raise their voices.”\n\nThe unexpected timing did not stop protesters, however. A growing crowd gathered outside the Texas Governor’s Mansion Sunday evening for a vigil and protest in response to the bill’s signing. Immigrant rights activists shouted “here to stay” and held up a banner with a words, “Abbott is a racist.”\n\n“Today, on a Sunday, on the Lord’s day, he decides to sign this bill,” one protester shouted into a megaphone. “This bill that will terrorize communities.”\n\n[Texas lawmaker on four-day hunger strike in protest of ‘sanctuary city’ bill]\n\nBlanco said it was “disrespectful” to sign the legislation — which faced fierce opposition from pastors and church organizations — on a Sunday, when many Latino and immigrant families are at church.\n\n“It’s ironic that he does it on a Sunday when families are together and this legislation is only going to tear families apart,” Blanco said.\n\nThe bill, which opponents promised to challenge in court, exposed a divide between the state’s top elected officials and its major law enforcement officers similar to the rift surrounding the Trump administration’s attempt to punish sanctuary cities, which has been held up at least temporarily by a federal court.\n\n“We officers work extremely hard to build and maintain trust, communication, and stronger relationships with minority communities through community based policing and outreach programs,” said a commentary endorsed by the top cops in Dallas, Houston, Austin, Arlington, Fort Worth and San Antonio, along with the executive director of the Texas Police Chiefs Association.\n\n“Broad rules,” such as those in the new law, “will further strain the relationship between local law enforcement and these diverse communities” at a time with “distrust and fear of contacting or assisting the police has already become evident among legal immigrants.”","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T06:21:00.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-05-01/AP/Immigration_Protest_Texas_29335-9c02f.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"mIV2E/p9s9A/hkWQz7J9Gg==\n"}

Meyer was in China seeking more than $150 million in investment in a luxury apartment complex project in New Jersey. (Albee Zhang/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA much-criticized visa program that allows foreigners to win fast-track immigration in return for investing $500,000 in U.S. properties was extended in a bill signed by President Trump just one day before a sister of senior White House adviser Jared Kushner pitched the program to Chinese investors.\n\nTrump, who advocates for restrictive immigration policies, extended the EB-5 investor program without long-promised changes as part of a massive federal spending bill. The program has offered wealthy foreigners a way around complicated U.S. immigration rules, allowing them to live in the United States and seek permanent residency in return for substantial investments.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Saturday that Nicole Kushner Meyer delivered a sales presentation in Beijing at which she urged Chinese citizens to invest in a New Jersey project being managed by the Kushner family’s real estate company. Meyer’s relationship to her brother was mentioned as part of the presentation.\n\nOn Sunday, the Kushner Companies, of which Meyer is a principal, said in an email to The Post that it “apologizes if that mention of her brother was in any way interpreted as an attempt to lure investors. That was not Ms. Meyer’s intention.”\n\nThe firm stressed that Jared Kushner “stepped away from the company in January and has nothing to do with this project,” which it said would provide $180 million in tax revenue over 30 years.\n\nWhite House senior adviser Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump walk on the South Lawn of the White House on May 4. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nKushner, who is Trump’s son-in-law and headed his family’s real estate company until he agreed to serve in the White House, helped oversee the New Jersey luxury apartment project while managing the family’s vast real estate holdings.\n\nMeyer’s sales presentation about the EB-5 investor visa program brought pointed criticism from Democrats, who said she sought to benefit from her ties to her brother, who, as the husband of Ivanka Trump, has become one of Trump’s closest advisers.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee, said in an interview Sunday that it was “pretty sketchy” for Meyer to make her sales pitch given that the program’s continued existence is in doubt, and the backlog of applications from Chinese investors may add five years to the process. In 2014, 85 percent of investor visas were issued to Chinese applicants.\n\n“The fact that she is the sister to the top adviser to the president makes it even worse,” Lofgren said.\n\nThe sales pitch put a spotlight on what has long been a controversial program. A raft of reports from federal agencies have said it is a bureaucratic nightmare, prone to abuse and difficult to justify in terms of economic return. Members of both parties have said it should be killed or overhauled. The Obama administration proposed that the price of the least-expensive investor visas go from $500,000 to $1.3 million, and it left it to the Trump administration to decide whether to implement the change.\n\nA White House spokesman said the administration would work with Congress to evaluate “wholesale reform” of the program, which might include “raising the price of the visa.”\n\nThis year, a bipartisan group of legislators proposed changes that included making it more costly to participate and more difficult to defraud the government. The changes included attempts to revive the program’s original intent of providing investment in rural and distressed urban areas in the United States. In recent years, developers have found ways to funnel investments to high-priced urban areas such as Manhattan by expanding the application area to include lower-income neighborhoods.\n\nHowever, the two leaders of the reform effort, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), said in a March 14 letter that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a real estate group were undercutting the reforms.\n\nThe senators wrote that the business organizations “may have recently agreed to a secretive backroom ‘deal’ that undercuts the many good faith efforts we have made during the past two years.” They said the business groups were trying to preempt their proposed reforms with “window dressing.”\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Chamber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe failure to overhaul the program did not lead Congress to suspend it. Instead, with the program set to expire, Congress tucked a program extension into a spending bill that passed Congress on Thursday. The overall measure was signed by Trump on Friday.\n\nTrump has made immigration overhaul the centerpiece of his campaign and administration. He has called for the construction of a wall on the Mexican border, proposed that the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants be expelled, and called for a ban on many immigrants from some Muslim-majority countries.\n\nAsked why Trump signed a bill allowing the continuation of the investor visa program, a White House spokesman said that Trump had little leeway to adjust a spending bill that was largely assembled by the Obama administration, although Trump did seek to shape the measure in other ways, such as money for the border wall.\n\nIt was a day after Trump signed the bill that Meyer made her presentation in Beijing in which she and her associates urged the Chinese to invest in the luxury apartment building, One Journal Square, which is slated to be built next year in Jersey City. “Invest early, and you will invest under the old rules,” one speaker said. A brochure put it even more plainly: “Invest $500,000 and immigrate to the United States.”\n\nThere is no suggestion that Trump signed the bill to help the Kushner firm get investments from the Chinese, but the timing underscored the tenuous nature of the program.\n\nThe investor visa program was designed to entice overseas investors to put $500,000 into projects, mainly in higher-unemployment areas, creating at least 10 jobs, or $1 million in wealthier areas. In return, an investor would receive the right to live in the United States and seek permanent residency after two years.\n\nA federal watchdog agency, the Government Accountability Office, said in two recent reports that the program is subject to fraud and abuse, and that the economic benefits are questionable. One report said that many applications are thousands of pages long, requiring a review of more than 14 million pages a year in a system that still relies largely on paper documents.\n\nFederal auditors said that the government should improve scrutiny of the source of investment funds, noting a case in which a petitioner was found to have potential financial ties “to a number of brothels in China,” according to an August 2015 report by the GAO. That investor was not approved for the program.\n\nKushner has previously raised $50 million from the program to help finance construction of Trump Bay Street, a 50-story apartment building in Jersey City, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nKushner has promised to recuse himself from any administration decisions about the future of the program, a spokesman said.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T13:19:00.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/08/National-Politics/Images/AFP_O679N.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"orKs0xc7DQpf+OeQ6lgXPQ==\n"}

Boko Haram kidnapped his grandson in 2014.\n\nMany of the children of Damasak were abducted in fall 2014, a few months after the militants hauled off the 276 girls from the Chibok Government Secondary School.\n\nBoko Haram insurgents descended on Damasak on Nov. 24, 2014 and honed in on Zanna Mobarti Primary School, locking more than 300 students, ages 7 to 17, inside. The militants then turned the school into a military base where they brought in more captives, according to the Human Rights Watch.\n\nIn March 2015, Boko Haram insurgents fled after security forces from the neighboring countries of Chad and Niger advanced on Damasak, taking with them their captives. They returned the following month before military forces finally forced them out of the town in July 2016.\n\nResidents say more than 500 have been kidnapped. They’ve submitted the names of the missing to local authorities, but families have yet to receive a response.\n\nThe Chibok girls have largely been the focus of government efforts. Nigeria’s House of Representatives adopted a motion last month urging the executive branch to expedite negotiations for the girls’ release.\n\n“As you know, within the limits of what can be disclosed, there’s a lot of negotiations that are going on and we continue to negotiate with those individuals who are holding the Chibok girls,” Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said in an interview with the Guardian shortly before the girls were released. “We have gone quite far with negotiations for, you know, hopefully another batch of the girls.”\n\nRelated Articles May 6, 2017 Nigerian official says 83 Chibok girls kidnapped by Boko Haram have been released On Saturday, Nigerian officials hailed Buhari for the release of 82 of the 276 Chibok girls.\n\n“However, the work is not yet done, too many families are still anxious today,” Senate President Abubakar Bukola Saraki said in a statement. “Too many of our daughters have not returned.”\n\nMore than 100 of the Chibok girls have so far been returned, including the 20 who were released last year.\n\nThe Nigerian government released five Boko Haram commanders in exchange for the 82 girls, according to the Associated Press.\n\nNigerian officials say Buhari is committed to the release of the rest of the Chibok girls and other Boko Haram captives.","author":"The Washington Post","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T05:38:36.000Z"},"source":"google-news","urlToImage":"http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/afp_o726p_15947177.jpg?w=1024\u0026h=683","class":"World","digest":"6tPWY6JtL7CfCiKnQUjntQ==\n"}

But to the Trump administration, they are irrelevant, because all that counts is what the president said and did after he took the oath of office.\n\nThe government is urging the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to lift a stay imposed by a federal judge in Maryland on March 16 blocking the administration from carrying out the executive order.

Courts must judge the constitutionality of the executive order by what it says, \"not by what supposedly lies at the heart of its drafters.\"\n\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a group of refugee aid organizations and Muslim residents whose overseas relatives are seeking visas, says Trump never disavowed his plan to target Muslim immigration.\n\n\"President Trump publicly committed himself to an indefensible goal: banning Muslims from coming to the United States,\" and the court should consider those statements in deciding whether the executive order is based on anti-Muslim animus, the ACLU says.\n\nRelated: Attorneys General Say Trump Travel Order Harms Universities, Medical Institutions, Tourism\n\nUnder the government's approach, the ACLU says, if a politician campaigned on a promise to make Christianity the national religion, the courts would be forbidden to consider the candidate's speeches, literature and websites, no matter how specific and consistent the promises, how quickly they were carried out after the election and how much they affected non-Christians.\n\nThe administration's lawyers say the revised order — imposing a 90-day ban on travel from Iran, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — was intended to enhance national security by allowing the government to study its ability to properly vet visa applications from those countries.\n\nThe goal was not to restrict travel by Muslims, the Justice Department says in its legal brief submitted ahead of Monday's courtroom showdown. \"Those countries represent a small fraction of the world's 50 Muslim-majority nations and approximately ten percent of the global Muslim population.\"\n\nWhat's more, the government says, any claim of discrimination now is premature, because visa applicants from those countries can seek waivers from the executive order.

The harm to Muslims in the United States is immediate, the ACLU says, because the Trump order creates feelings of marginalization and exclusion.\n\nThe challengers \"invoke their rights to be free from government condemnation of their religion within the United States,\" the ACLU says.\n\nTrump's original travel order, issued seven days after his inauguration on Jan. 20, was blocked by court rulings. Enforcement of the revised order, which was to have taken effect on March 16, was also barred by a federal judge in Hawaii. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear an appeal of that ruling later in the month.\n\nBoth appeals courts would have to rule in the administration's favor to allow enforcement of the revised executive order.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59101489522ffcfb9a9ac775"},"description":"There was plenty of chaos in the Badlands this week as Widow and Quinn joined forces against the Barons.","title":"Into the Badlands: \"Sting of the Scorpion's Tail\" Review - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/05/08/into-the-badlands-sting-of-the-scorpions-tail-review","text":"Share. Sunny returns to the badlands just in time. Sunny returns to the badlands just in time.\n\nWarning: Full spoilers for the episode below.\n\nInto the Badlands' second season is getting down to the wire, and that means it's time to start bringing the main cast back together. That's exactly what \"Sting of the Scorpion's Tail\" accomplished this week. After last week's relatively underwhelming installment, it was nice to see some significant progress as the show built towards a big showdown between Sunny, the Widow and Quinn.\n\nIt certainly didn't hurt that this episode opened strong with one of the more memorable fight sequences of recent weeks. I really enjoy the fact that every fight in this show feels a little different from what's come before, either in terms of styles used or cinematic influences. This one had a vague wuxia quality to it, with the emphasis on billowing billowing curtains and graceful swordplay. It reminded me more than a little of the showdown between Broken Sword and the King of Qin in 2002's Hero.\n\nAside from delivering more of the martial arts spectacle this series does so well, the opening served as a stark reminder of how drastically the balance of power is shifting in the Badlands. Widow and Quinn have succeeded in wiping another of their enemies off the board. With the traditional Barons dropping like flies and Sunny and friends finally making their way back home, it really does feel like the stage is being set for a major game-changer in the next two weeks. It's hard to imagine Quinn clinging to life much longer, especially with all the extra motivations he's offering Sunny to finish the fight they started in the Season 1 finale.\n\nThis also proved to be a very Quinn-heavy episode, which as usual is both a good and bad thing. It's always fun to watch Widow and Quinn interact, as it's clear both are very eager to take care of business and resume trying to kill one another. This episode also succeeded in shining a light on Widow's losing battle to maintain her morality. She's reduced to trying to justify handing Veil over to Quinn, telling herself and her daughter that she sacrificed one life for the good of countless others. Tilda clearly isn't buying it, hinting at an impending rift between mother and daughter in the near future. It seems very likely at this point that Widow will emerge the victor in this current Badlands civil war, only to lose the respect of her girls once it becomes clear how much she had to sacrifice to earn that victory.\n\nWe also saw plenty of Veil and Lydia this week, gaining insight into the private hell these two women now live as Quinn's captives. Veil's character arc has been hard to watch this season, as she's suffered so much and been given so little chance for revenge. Seeing her forced to marry and be bedded by the man who murdered her parents almost seems to be pushing things too far. I'm relieved that the writers stopped short of having her be raped by Quinn. That seems like an unnecessary burden to place on the character when she's already been given ample reason to fear and despise her new husband. At this point, I sincerely hope that Veil will be given the opportunity to exact a little vengeance before the season is through.\n\nElsewhere, Sunny, Baijie and M.K. made it about 30 feet underneath the wall before their long-distance trek hit another major snag. For Sunny, a man who's been struggling to put his past behind him all season long, this was an opportunity to put his reputation to use and work his way into the good graces of Baron Chau. I was glad to see the writers didn't go out of their way to play up the \"Is Sunny a traitor?\" angle. That would have been a pointless waste of time. Instead of slowing down his journey, this latest setback wound up propelling Sunny, Baijie and M.K. along and putting them directly in the Widow's path. And in the process, we got to see another big, character-defining moment for Baijie, as he could easily have left all this chaos behind and instead chose to plunge back into the lion's den alongside his new friends. That moment was both rousing and a bit foreboding. I'm not feeling confident about the odds of Baijie surviving the end of the season, and he may well have sealed his fate by choosing to remain in the fight.\n\nAll of this culminated with another terrific fight scene, as Sunny and Widow found themselves fighting side by side against Chau's Clippers. This was yet another example of the show's ability to handle large-scale battle scenes with dozens of combatants at once. The fight was chaotic, yet also graceful and easy to follow. There also a certain satisfaction in seeing these characters reunited and fighting a common enemy. Though it's doubtful this alliance will last very long. Widow may well be hoping that she can use Sunny and M.K. to consolidate her power and eliminate her ally. But she may be in for a ride awakening once Sunny finds out how Veil was treated during her brief time under Widow's \"protection.\" At the rate things are going, it'll be a wodner if any of these Barons are still alive by the end of the season.","author":"Jesse Schedeen","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T03:00:43.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/05/08/widowtilda-1280-1494207868516_1280w.jpg","class":"World","digest":"J8prHs3T5y5/zxkn8oXoqw==\n"}

Another heavy-hitter is entering the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Another heavy-hitter is entering the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nMarvel Studios usually keeps things pretty close to the vest when it comes to new characters making their Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, but not when it comes to Adam Warlock. Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn has already confirmed that he'll be returning to write and direct the third film in the series, and that he's developing cosmic heavy-hitter Warlock for future MCU use. Marvel boss Kevin Feige has also said that Warlock would likely show up in a future Guardians movie.\n\nBut who is Adam Warlock, and why is he such an important addition to the MCU? Read on to find out everything you need to know about this powerful but unstable Marvel hero.\n\nThe Basics\n\nAdam Warlock is one of the major players in Marvel's cosmic landscape. His innate, energy-based powers already make him a force to be reckoned with. But when he wields the awesome might of the Soul Gem, Warlock becomes one of the most powerful warriors in the universe. Warlock has been a frequent ally of teams like the Fantastic Four and the Guardians of the Galaxy, often fighting to protect the universe from villains who seek to rule it.\n\nHowever, Warlock is both one of the greatest threats to the Marvel Universe and one its most valiant defenders. That's because he has a darker side known as Magus. While Warlock has done his best to suppress or destroy this darker side, the universe is never quite safe from this tyrannical villain as long as Warlock himself survives.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nWarlock was genetically engineered by a group of scientists called the Enclave, who desired to create a genetically perfect, synthetic human. Warlock has your standard superhero abilities like strength, speed, durability and flight, as well as the ability to absorb and channel cosmic energy via \"Quantum magic.\" Warlock also has the ability to retreat into a regenerative cocoon and heal his body from mortal wounds.\n\nMuch of his power, however, is derived from the Soul Gem. One of the six gems that make up the Infinity Gauntlet, the Soul Gem allows Warlock to absorb the souls of other beings. It's this Soul Gem that caused a future incarnation of Warlock to become insane and transform into Magus.\n\nWarlock also briefly wielded all six Infinity Gems in the aftermath of 1991's Infinity Gauntlet storyline, making him one of the most powerful beings in existence.\n\nOrigin and Background\n\nLike a great many cosmic Marvel characters, Adam Warlock was originally created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in the pages of Fantastic Four (specifically in issues #66-67 in 1967). At the time, though, he was simply known as \"Him,\" and it wasn't until later when writers like Roy Thomas and Jim Starlin got their hands on the character that Warlock's back story and ongoing role in the Marvel U. was truly fleshed out. In these early stories, Warlock was treated as a messianic savior, with Thomas drawing heavy inspiration from the musical Jesus Christ Superstar.\n\nStarlin in particular played a major role in shaping the character. It was he who linked the character to the Soul Gem and established the ongoing rivalry between Warlock and the fanatical Church of Universal Truth, led by Warlock's insane future self, Magus. Starlin even killed off the character when Warlock traveled forward in time and drained his own soul to prevent himself from ever becoming Magus. Warlock eventually returned, and several different incarnations of Magus have followed.\n\nThe Infinity Gauntlet storyline served as what is arguably Warlock's most important act in the Marvel Universe, as he helped Earth's heroes overthrow the all-powerful Thanos and took possession of the Infinity Gauntlet for himself. That paved the way for a new series called Infinity Watch, where Warlock and his allies (Pip the Troll, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Moondragon and Thanos himself) safeguarded the Infinity Gems to prevent another villain from reassembling the Gauntlet.\n\nWarlock again rose to the forefront of the Marvel Universe during 2007's Annihilation: Conquest crossover. He returned to help shepherd a new incarnation of the Guardians of the Galaxy (the one that would go on to inspire the movies) and prevent the already fragile fabric of the Marvel Universe from being further damaged. Most recently, Warlock has been featured in several Thanos-centric graphic novels written and drawn by Starlin.\n\nBeyond the Comics\n\nAdam Warlock has made a number of small cameo appearances in various Marvel animated and video game projects. One of his first multimedia appearances came in Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems, which loosely adapts the Infinity Gauntlet storyline and features both Warlock and Magus. Warlock has also appeared in animated series like Silver Surfer, The Super Hero Squad Show, Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes and the direct-to-DVD animated movie Planet Hulk.\n\nAs the Guardians of the Galaxy have become a more prominent fixture in Marvel's various multimedia projects, so too has Adam Warlock. He recently appeared in the second season of the Guardians of the Galaxy cartoon (voiced in adult form by Eric Bauza and in child form by Tara Strong). He's also a playable character in the mobile game Avengers Alliance.\n\nExpect plenty more Warlock on TV and in Marvel's games as the character begins to leave his mark on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Warlock sort of already made his MCU debut in 2013's Thor: The Dark World, as director James Gunn has said the cocoon seen in The Collector's trophy room did indeed house Warlock's body. Warlock was originally planned to appear in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but Gunn elected to leave him out rather than cram too many characters into one film (and the filmmaker has since backed away from the notion of that cocoon actually belonging to Warlock). However, Gunn and Marvel boss Kevin Feige have confirmed to Slash Film that Gunn is developing the character for future use. “If he appears anywhere in the future, it’ll be in Guardians,” Feige said. Still, Warlock is not expected to appear in 2018's Avengers: Infinity War. As for its 2019 sequel, that remains to be seen given how closely tied the character is to the Infinity Gauntlet...\n\nJesse is a mild-mannered writer for IGN.

For more on American Gods, make sure to read our spoiler-free review of the series premiere and actress Yetide Badaki's story behind Bilquis's big sex scene.\n\nBryan Fuller isn't pulling his punches when it comes to lacing political and cultural commentary through American Gods, and race -- particularly Shadow Moon's race -- was a primary focus of the series' second episode.\n\nAfter the flashy and bloody Vikings opening sequence in the series premiere, \"The Secret of Spoon's\" introduction to Orlando Jones' Anansi was about as pointed a statement as Fuller and co-showrunner Michael Green can make, and was the more effective for it. Jones' monologue delivery was chill-inducing during the \"Coming to America\" opening, as he told a ship full of slaves about the fraught future they had ahead of them in America.\n\nOne way or another, though, Anansi did make it to American shores, and Shadow Moon is our dark-skinned hero with a fraught future in the present day. As Anansi foretold and as Shadow finds out in this episode, he's going to get \"f**ked\" over the course of this journey. It's interesting and important that this race-themed episode came after the end of \"The Bone Orchard,\" which saw the Technical Boy's goons hang Shadow from a tree before some mysterious person rescued him. That's some loaded imagery, and American Gods was smart not to let it lie; that doesn't seem like something Fuller and Green are interested in doing.\n\nAmerican Gods: \"The Secret Of Spoons\" Photos 11 IMAGES View Slideshow Return To Article Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC American Gods: \"The Secret Of Spoons\" Photos OF 11 Download\n\nIn that way, \"The Secret of the Spoon\" is a really strong episode. Shadow might have a tough road ahead of him, as we find out from Zorya (by the way, Cloris freakin' Leachman!), but he's not the only dark-skinned import to find themselves screwed over again and again. We check back in with Bilquis, who had the biggest episode-stealing moment in the premiere, to find out she isn't especially happy about her current state of affairs -- even if her victims don't seem to be so upset about where they, umm, find themselves. Even Peter Stormare's Czernobog helps keep the thread alive. After starting the episode with such a strong and direct opening statement, the more subtle weaving of the theme of race through the rest of \"The Secret of the Spoon\" made for a thoughtful exploration of the topic.\n\nIn terms of structure, though, a lot of the momentum of \"The Secret of the Spoon\" started in the first half of the episode and then fizzled out by the end. From Anansi's introduction through the arrival in Chicago, American Gods was just as good, if not better, than its season premiere. The way Fuller and Green wove back in Laura Moon so we can understand a bit more of her death's impact on Shadow and the way he perceived her before her betrayal was very effective. And the second best sequence in the episode (first being Anansi's opening scene) is the always fabulous Gillian Anderson making her debut as the goddess Media.\n\nRicky Whittle plays Shadow as the straight man, with even Mr. Wednesday addressing Shadow's decided lack of charisma in this episode, but the reason why that doesn't drag down the energy of this series is because of the colorful characters who surround him. The audience is seeing this crazy new world of old gods vs. new gods through Shadow's eyes, which is why the sense of being thrown in over your head mostly works. With characters like Media, you understand what she is and what she represents when Anderson delivers lines where she talks about how TV became a new god that everyone started to worship; the same with the Technical Boy. Even characters like Anansi and Bilquis make sense in context, even if you aren't completely brushed up on your global mythology.\n\nThat's a big part of why the second half of the episode doesn't work as well as the first. Mr. Wednesday lays out what seems to be the structure of this season when he tells Shadow the plan is for them to reunite with a bunch of people at one of the most important places in America, but not before he goes to Chicago to get his \"hammer.\" It's clear Stormare's Czernobog is that hammer, but the show makes a mistake in not better establishing who he is, who the Zorya sisters are or why they're so important to Mr. Wednesday that he would come bearing gifts and risk Shadow Moon's life to get them to come with him.\n\nA little digging can give you your answer, but it's likely not common knowledge that Czernobog is a Slavic deity whose name literally means \"black god,\" or that his \"light\" brother who he keeps referencing is the Slavic god of light, Belobog. The same goes for the Zorya sisters, who represent the Morning, Evening and Midnight Stars. Knowing that puts those scenes into better context, but because it plays out lacking it, the entire back half of the episode loses a lot of steam -- not even Stormare's excellent monologuing can keep it up. Once again, an episode of American Gods ends with Shadow's life in the balance, suitably tying back to the idea that he is totally \"f**ked.\"\n\nA few small Easter eggs: that guy Mr. Wednesday was talking to when Shadow showed up at the diner is the Djinn, who we'll be seeing more of soon. That \"Motel America\" has the same bison on it that Shadow was dreaming about (and also I really want to own that shirt). Also that line about \"Lucy's tits\" is straight out of the Neil Gaiman novel, so that should tickle the book readers out there.","author":"Terri Schwartz","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T02:00:57.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/05/05/americangods-1280-1-1494025468187_1280w.jpg","class":"Entertainment","digest":"i1KcBFFsYx99dyDRDDG2hQ==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5910148c522ffcfb9a9ac77e"},"description":"Kevin and Nora head to Australia and embark on separate emotionally hectic adventures in a fantastic episode.","title":"The Leftovers: \"G'Day Melbourne\" Review - IGN","url":"http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/05/08/the-leftovers-gday-melbourne-review","text":"Share. An A-Ha Moment. An A-Ha Moment.\n\nWarning: Full spoilers for the episode below.\n\nKevin and Nora headed to Australia this week in the fantastic and frantic \"G'Day Melbourne,\" each experiencing their own deeply personal existential crisis and then ultimately breaking up in the final moments. For good, we can probably assume (from the premiere's flash-forward and -- well -- the number of episodes left). I mean, there's a chance for reconciliation, sure, but having Ray LaMontagne's \"This Love is Over\" play un-ironically over this week's opening credits suggests a permanence to the split.\n\nAs much as I adore Kevin and Nora as a couple, and relish the season finales that came before this year where the two of them seemed to both find and embrace the idea of a reconstructed family in a broken world, they are both fundamentally shattered people. And the scab that got picked at back in \"Don't Be Ridiculous,\" regarding Nora's ever-present longing for her lost children, was ripped off here as she headed to Melbourne with the intent of joining them -- AKA possibly being disintegrated by scam artists.\n\nSure, her story was that she was out to bust the scientists, despite having no jurisdiction, and the show played around wonderfully with the suspense of that idea, but last week when Nora agreed, on the phone, to head to Australia, she did it so quickly, with such intent, that it truly suggested that she was desperate to go through with the experiment. Kevin then wanted to go with her because he could feel her leaving him. He'd probably felt it for a while, ever since she gave Lily back to her real mother.\n\nSo this dynamic -- Nora leaving and Kevin worried about her leaving -- all played out down under in spectacular fashion. Kevin's dilemma shifted from him thinking he was seeing ghosts again to him believing he'd uncovered a conspiracy - all of it representing his underlying fear of Nora abandoning him because of his \"specialness.\" Which is a nagging issue that's been amplified due to Matt's book. Meanwhile, Nora headed into her meeting with the scientists as a skeptic, but a skeptic who was still, most likely, ready to go through with the experiment.\n\nThe Leftovers: \"G’Day Melbourne\" Photos 3 IMAGES View Slideshow Return To Article Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC The Leftovers: \"G’Day Melbourne\" Photos OF 3 Download\n\nThough, truth be told, we'll never know. Would she have put a halt to things at the eleventh hour? Was she there to take them down? We know how much Nora likes to bust scams and deflate false ideas. What Nora doesn't know, however, is that there's a high possibility that there's no experiment at all. That no one gets chosen to \"go through.\" On the same episode that Kevin thought he'd discovered a main member of the Guilty Remnant alive in Evie, the viewers may have discovered a brand new GR-style of toxicity. Exploiting people's grief, making them desperate to die, and then rejecting them.\n\nLast week, I mentioned how this final season is doing a great job at raising mysteries and then answering them a week later. We didn't get a full answer as to what the scientists are ultimately after, but we now know why the man in the desert lit himself on fire. He'd been rejected. Even though he gave the opposite answer of Nora's. There's a good chance they turn you down no matter what. Why would a medical exam be necessary? Or being put in a crate? Why is there any type of \"criteria\" for being bombarded with radiation? It might just all be about discomfort, trepidation, and then...the total let down. Every victim being someone who'd suffered a significant loss in the Departure and was probably, now, finally at a place where they were moving on.\n\nKevin easily sensed the distance between himself and Nora, even before they boarded the plane. Nora's head was already floating off, ready to be with her kids, and it was all she could do to provide a flimsy lie so that he'd be satiated for the few hours before she got her phone call. The sex the two of them had in the airport bathroom too was a way to distract, as well as be with him one final time (as she didn't know how much time they'd have once the plane landed.)\n\nBy the time the two of them met back up in the evening, having experienced separate days of panic and fear (Kevin went from thinking he'd lost it to thinking he was sane to...finding out he'd really lost it), everything in their relationship peeled back. Harsh words were said, Matt's bible was shredded and burned, and Nora was left smoking in a room getting doused with sprinklers. It was a devastating scene delivered by two powerhouse actors. The imagery, juxtaposed with A-ha's \"Take on Me,\" painted a lavish and painful portrait of love conquered and defeated by the enormity of loss.\n\nLeftovers leftovers:\n\nAs stated, it's possible that people are still being disintegrated, though wouldn't it be funny for Mark Linn-Baker to get caught again - being alive?\n\nThe opening credit song wasn't played for ironic layering this week, but we did get a terrific ton of \"Take on Me,\" in different forms too. This show and Hulu's Handmaid's Tale are doing excellent work by pairing anguish with throwback '80s cheer (though Handmaid has way more agony to overcome).\n\nI feel like people calmly calling for security on Kevin and then nonchalantly explaining \"He's being weird\" could be its own series.\n\nWith as much as the scientists know about Nora, it's totally believable that they were behind the woman and the baby, though it did seem like she was in there for a job interview. That being said, any good scammer would know about Nora and Lily and Nora's attempt to start a new life with a new child.\n\nKevin thinking that Evie was still alive was a masterful way of playing into/praying on viewers' expectations and predictions about Evie possibly being alive after her brief appearance in the premiere.\n\nWhat's this \"explosion\" that's grounded all flights? I have a feeling we'll find out next week.\n\nThat image of Nora sitting on the bed, getting soaked by the sprinklers, is devastating.","author":"Matt Fowler","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T01:59:33.000Z"},"source":"ign","urlToImage":"http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/05/06/eunnamed-1494092558019_1280w.jpg","class":"Regional News","digest":"qG0lDKXNPd4mf/tQjZSE+w==\n"}

How Codemasters is bringing back a pioneer of social gaming. How Codemasters is bringing back a pioneer of social gaming.\n\nKevin McCallister had way more Micro Machines than I did. I was only seven years old when I first saw Home Alone so that was obviously my primary concern at the time.\n\nOne of the slightly less deadly booby traps for the hapless Harry and Marv, Kevin’s collection covered the whole floor. He had more than I could count! I had about 12, plus an oil can that turned into a mechanic’s garage that I got for not dying while I had my tonsils removed.\n\nBut despite a supreme slice of product placement in what would become 1990’s highest-grossing film worldwide, 1990 was actually a disaster for the home of Micro Machines: US toy manufacturer Galoob. The recession of the early ’90s had kicked the company right in the crotch.\n\nMicro Machines, Galoob’s most successful product to date, was chosen as the key to dragging the company back into profitability – and it worked. Sales spiked and, despite their diminutive size, Micro Machines became the biggest thing in die-cast cars – Hot Wheels, Matchbox, and Majorette be damned.\n\nBut Micro Machines weren’t content with remaining in the toy box and, following the aforementioned cameo alongside Macaulay Culkin on the big screen, the world’s teensiest turbos hit centre stage on the small screen in Codemasters’ original Micro Machines game.\n\nMicro Machines, which first appeared as an unlicensed NES game and was subsequently released on a host of other platforms across the first few years of the ’90s, was an immediate hit. In fact, it was instrumental in catapulting Codemasters from being a budget 8-bit games publisher to becoming one of the UK’s top independent studios, and spawned a successful series.\n\nThen, after the release of Micro Machines V4 in 2006, it went away.\n\nGone.\n\nBut not forgotten.\n\n“It seems to have gone down very well,” says Codemasters’ Dan Robinson on the announcement of Micro Machines World Series back in January. “People seem to be very keen to see Micro Machines come back; it’s one of the games we built our heritage on [along with] Colin McRae Rally.”\n\n“Micro Machines is one of those games that we’ve been asked for I don’t know how many years to bring back.”\n\n“ People seem to be very keen to see Micro Machines come back; it’s one of the games we built our heritage on [along with] Colin McRae Rally.\n\nAccording to Robinson, Micro Machines has been one of the most requested games on the Codemasters forums for the studio to resurrect. Perhaps the most requested.\n\n“I was always slightly disappointed it wasn’t Jonah Lomu Rugby,” he chuckles.\n\nMicro Machines actually reappeared as a mobile only game mid-last year but it’s the prospect of a new console and PC version that’s really lit a fire in the bellies of former fans.\n\n“It was with quite a lot of joy we announced it,” Robinson continues. “We obviously put a mobile version out in July last year; it was a free-to-play game that’s done very well for us.”\n\n“There seems to be a real appetite for Micro Machines as a game, as a brand, but obviously we did some things in the mobile game that were a little different to how the original games were – the whole Battle Mode, and the Arena side of things.”\n\nRobinson confirms Micro Machines on mobile racked up over 2.5 million installs in the first four months.\n\n“It proved really popular for us,” he says. “But the amount of comments that we got that said, ‘Okay, I just want this on my console now; make an actual Micro Machines game for my PS4 or my Xbox One.’ So it’s great news that we’re bringing it back.”\n\nMicro Machines World Series even trended on Twitter in the UK after Codemasters announced it, “which is ridiculous for a Micro Machines game, really,” says Robinson. “But obviously we’re very proud of that.”\n\n“We didn’t get that with F1,” he jokes.\n\nMicro Machines World Series may be following it mobile resurrection but it is not a port of the mobile game.\n\n“It’d make my life much easier if we did,” laughs chief game designer Gavin Cooper.\n\n“It’s a very different game,” says Robinson. “We’re aware that the free-to-play audience on mobile is very different to a console audience. If we’d done that we’d either have not made a good mobile game or we’d have absolutely peeved off all the console gamers.”\n\n“Bringing back Micro Machines with all the fanfare that we’re doing currently… and then we go, ‘Oh, it’s just a port of the mobile game.’ People would’ve just gone, “That’s sh-t. Don’t do that.”\n\n“ We’re aware that the free-to-play audience on mobile is very different to a console audience.\n\nAccording to Robinson, Micro Machines World Series has emerged as a mix of traditional Micro Machines action and current game design philosophies.\n\n“With Micro Machines World Series, it’s really a competitive, accessible, fun, multiplayer game; they’re the things that are really at the heart of the new game, but they’re really what were at the heart of all the previous games,” he says. “Historically it was always about playing with your mates. It was all about sitting in the same room and destroying each other, basically, but doing it in a fun way.”\n\n“For us there aren’t many games out there that are multiplayer that are just for fun. You know, Call of Duty is obviously a massive multiplayer game but it’s quite serious. If you lose you’re actually really annoyed. I think with Micro Machines it is that pick-up-and-play sense of fun, doing it again, having a go. You build up those sibling rivalries. That’s what Micro Machines is always about, so it was important for us to bring that back.\n\n“But we also needed to move it on from the original games.”\n\nHere Robinson namechecks Toybox Turbos, a miniature car racing game Codemasters released back in 2014.\n\n“We always toy when we talk to people: “Do we mention Toybox Turbos?” he grins, muttering under his breath. “Toybox Turbos? Does anyone remember Toybox Turbos?”\n\n“The thing about Toybox Turbos, when we brought that out two-and-a-half years ago, was that it really represented just what Micro Machines was. It was just the racing. And I think people went, ‘Ah, this is cool’ and they played it and said, ‘I remember that; it’s really good! But now I’m going to get back to playing my 21st Century games which are a lot more fun, I get a lot more involved, there’s a lot more to do.’\n\n“And so a lot of the comments that we had from Toybox Turbos were that there wasn’t anywhere near enough multiplayer content in there, and it didn’t have the real name – it was kind of a Micro Machines wannabe, really.\n\n“So obviously… we toyed with the idea: is it worth us doing this again? But there seemed to be a real appetite for it.”\n\nRobinson confirms that going back to Hasbro and resurrecting the name was important to the team from a brand point-of-view, but it was more important to the team at Codemasters to start moving the game on and make it more appealing for longer to modern gamers.\n\n“Yes, there are people like our good selves in this room who just want Micro Machines back because I remember how good it used to be,” explains Robinson. “It tugs on the heartstrings; it makes me remember stuff I used to do when I was 15, 16, or whatever.”\n\n“But we have to also bring it for those people who play your Rocket League, your Overwatch, your Trackmania games, who want more. They want to do more. They want to be able to battle, they want to take it online, they want to compete in leagues and on leaderboards. They want something more from the game that just a racing game.\n\n“We’ve been very careful from a development perspective and also from a publishing perspective to make sure that this is a game that appeals to both audiences. To those guys that do want their retro hit, but they also want something new; they want something that’s gonna challenge them as a modern game.”\n\n“ [Micro Machines] was one of the pioneers of social gaming before social gaming was even a thing.\n\nRobinson stresses the team isn’t trying to distance itself from the original Micro Machines, but they are definitely focused on beefing it up.\n\n“We can’t get away from the legend that was Micro Machines,” concedes Robinson. “It was one of the pioneers of social gaming before social gaming was even a thing. People used to block out Friday nights to get their mates around to play Micro Machines. There were Micro Machines parties. It really was quite a phenomenon.”\n\n“But that’s not to say the original games weren’t without problems. I think V4 had some critical comments about it, largely because we’d not moved the series on. It just felt like we were making Micro Machines again and again and again and again. This all played into the design [of Micro Machines World Series] and what we wanted to do: ‘If we bring it back it has to move on.’”\n\nThe result is a game that emphasises battling as much as racing.\n\n“We found that, with the mobile game, people came to the game for the racing because they remembered Micro Machines and they knew what it meant,” explains Robinson. “But the reason they stayed playing it were the Battle Modes.”\n\n“It wasn’t even modes,” stresses Cooper. “It was Battle Mode. It was singular. It was just the one; it was a very simple deathmatch. We’ve built on that massively in terms of adding new modes for the console version.”\n\nThe team confirms there will be 10 race tracks and 15 Battle Arenas (which support up to 12 players). Iconic environments will make an unsurprising return.\n\n“ It wouldn’t really be a Micro Machines game if you weren’t racing on the kitchen table, or on the pool table.\n\n“It wouldn’t really be a Micro Machines game if you weren’t racing on the kitchen table, or on the pool table,” says Robinson. “But we wanted to bring in some new environments as well.”\n\nThe team showcase a pool table race and a deathmatch set in a backyard. The pool table is especially impressive – particularly the lighting, which convincingly seats both all the trackside objects and the toy cars in the world. It’s bright and bold and quite a bit more nuanced than the simple, cartoon-like world I’d expected. You won’t mistake it for an actual pool table but everything from the texture of the baize on the playing surface to the gleam of the polished balls has a more realistic edge to it. I like it a lot.\n\nThere will be 12 vehicles in Micro Machines World Series (an eclectic assortment featuring emergency vehicles, GI Joe vehicles, a dump truck, and ice cream truck, a spy car, and more).\n\n“In previous games the cars were pretty much identical, whereas now we treat them almost like a cast of heroes,” explains Cooper. “So they’ve got their own abilities, their own loadouts and weapons and tricks that they can pull out of the bag. Those are complimentary, so I can pick something that’s got some nice support skills so I can help my mates out even if I’m not necessarily getting all the kills myself.”\n\nCooper explains that it won’t be crucial to make sure teams are methodically balanced before wading into the Battle Modes, but there will be certain synergies between vehicle types for players to discover.\n\n“The reason that we called it World Series was a little bit of a nod to our American friends, who have the baseball world series but, frankly, it only involves people in North America,” grins Robinson. “Similarly, this is the Micro Machines World Series, for everyone within the confines of that one house. So it’s a bit tongue in cheek there.”\n\n“But also – for the first time – you’re going to be able to play anyone in the world. That’s what Micro Machines is about now; it’s about going online, it’s about taking everyone else on, competing in leaderboards, divisions, monthly challenges.\n\n“So for people who just want knockabout fun with their mates, that’s there; but if you want to take it online and become a serious Micro Machines player – if there is a thing – then that’s absolutely in there.\n\n“We know from Dirt Rally last year the importance of leaderboards and regular challenges. Monthly, weekly, daily challenges – that just keeps people coming back for more. There’s always something to feed that hunger for more content. Reaching the next leaderboard, being rewarded for topping those leaderboard – that’s really important for today’s game. That’s one of the main things that sets the game apart from the originals.”\n\n“ Ultimately, you’re in an ice cream van on a kitchen table trying to avoid jam.\n\nRobinson insists, however, that the personality of the game remains the same as ever. At Codemasters the team has taken to using none other than Buzz Lightyear as a key example of what that personality is.\n\n“The reason is, when you’re actually playing the game – you’re in the middle of it – it’s the most important thing you’re doing,” begins Robinson. “It really matters that you’ve just been blasted or blown up, or you’ve hit a mine, or whatever it is. But ultimately, you’re in an ice cream van on a kitchen table trying to avoid jam. It’s a ridiculous situation to be in, but when you’re in that moment it’s really important.”\n\n“So the whole Buzz Lightyear thing is Buzz genuinely believes he’s a space ranger – he’s there to save the world and can fly. Everyone else knows that he’s a toy. And that’s a similar thing to Micro Machines. When you’re in the race you think that this is a really, really serious race, so it really matters, but when you take a step back you look at it you go, ‘But I’ve just been catapulted into a toaster.’”\n\nThe incredibly enthusiastic reaction to Micro Machines World Series is not something I find surprising but it is something I find fascinating considering the toys upon which the game is based – save for a smattering of Star Wars branded miniatures – virtually don’t exist in the modern day.\n\n“ As soon as Codemasters talks about a miniature vehicle racing-based game, the world seems to lose its mind a little bit.\n\n“I think to a certain extent we’re almost immune to it at this point,” says Cooper. “Working here, specifically; I don’t think I’ve ever performed an interview for somebody coming in where they haven’t asked about Micro Machines… There are a lot of people who are really, really up for this.”\n\n“And it differs from territory to territory,” adds Robinson. “Like, the UK: it’s very much game first, toys second. In the US it’s the complete opposite; they know it for the toy and the game is less well-known.”\n\n“It always surprised us, and a little bit with Toybox Turbos as well, that as soon as Codemasters talks about a miniature vehicle racing-based game, the world seems to lose its mind a little bit, and goes, ‘Micro Machines?! Wicked!’\n\n“What we can’t do, really, is disappoint them. It’s kind of like your favourite aunt who you suddenly find out a dark secret about – ‘No, don’t ruin that memory!’’ So you’ve got to be really careful.”\n\nLuke is Games Editor at IGN's Sydney office.

Damage, not DPS: Damage is the most important stat for the sniper. Your marksman rifle will give at least 100% bonus damage for each headshot, so to maximize damage potential you want your overall DPS stat as high as possible.

Developer Cygames on building a highly competitive card battler for mobile first. Developer Cygames on building a highly competitive card battler for mobile first.\n\nWhen I first heard about Shadowverse last year, I had no expectations whatsoever. My initial reaction was to assume that it was simply the latest in the stream of digital CCGs that were springing up in the wake of Hearthstone’s incredible success. I didn’t know anything of the story behind the game, and while I’d come across developer Cygames’ work in a tangential sense (mostly at TGS), I didn’t even know the studio by name.\n\nIt soon became clear that Shadowverse was worth paying attention to, however. Hopping in revealed a pretty unique experience – each class had a very clear identity (often driven by bespoke mechanics), the core gameplay incorporated the ability to “evolve” cards, and the card design gave combo and control archetypes plenty of viable tools to use.\n\nSince then I’ve continued to play, and have seen the English language community around the game grow. I’ve also seen first-hand just how big the studio is. What's the story behind Shadowverse? And how did developer Cygames get here?\n\n“Cygames was set up in 2011 by our CEO, Koichi Watanabe, to make the sort of games that he wanted to make,” says Yuito Kimura, Game Producer and Executive Director at Cygames. “That was during the social game boom, so there was a big opportunity for self-publishing, and that enabled him to set up the company with the main goal of simply making the sort of games that he liked to play.”\n\nOne of those games was Rage of Bahamut, which – while popular in the West - was something of a phenomenon in Japan. Its success “actually wasn’t a surprise to us,” admits Kimura. “The development team all thought it was going to be a big hit while we were working on it. We had a lot of confidence in it and could see during development that it was a good game. But the scale of its success gave us the opportunity to make more games, and the type of games that we ourselves wanted to play. And at that time we were just 30 people, but that success gave us the resources to grow the company.”\n\nCygames, then, was built on the back of Rage of Bahamut, and has been growing ever since. The Shadowverse team alone “is now about 100 people,” says Kimura. The success of Rage of Bahamut also established an IP for the studio to work with, so it’s no surprise that Shadowverse takes place in the same world, with many of the same characters. It re-uses art assets from Rage of Bahamut and it also draws on it for thematic inspiration. The second Shadowverse expansion, for instance, was called Rise of Bahamut.\n\n“ “I have been a fan of Magic: The Gathering since high school. And I wanted to make a really strategic, tactical card game.” - Yuito Kimura.\n\nIt is, however, a radically different game - Shadowverse very much takes its gameplay cues from Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone. Work initially began on it in 2014, which is when Kimura left the Granblue Fantasy team to oversee the new project. “I have always been a fan of card games,” he tells me, thinking about the inspiration for Cygames to make a CCG. “I have been a fan of Magic: The Gathering since high school. And I wanted to make a really strategic, tactical card game.”\n\nKimura wasn’t alone in his obsession. “Japan has always had a lot of fans of card games,” he says. “Everybody played Yu-Gi-Oh! at school, or Pokémon, and everyone watches anime based on or around card games. So we thought there would be a big appetite for the game. And this type of card game had never really been done before in Japan.”\n\nNot only that, but the timing was right. “This was around the time that the mobile game market in Japan was really beginning to transition to smartphones,” he explains, “and I felt that the technology was there to make a really strategic card game. Borrowing the concept (and some card art) from Rage of Bahamut, I wanted to make a smartphone game with ‘Evolution’ as the core concept. I wanted to take things to a new level.”\n\nThis Evolution mechanic is certainly a compelling design element. It’s an ability that unlocks in the mid-game and can only be used a limited number of times. Any follower played to the board can be evolved, and most of the time this means a +2/+2 stat boost, but there are evolutions that do other things, such as spawn additional followers or allow the player to cast targeted damage. The most important part of the mechanic, however, is the fact that if you evolve a follower on the turn you play it, it’s then able to attack opposing followers. Your evolution points, then, are like having additional removal in your deck, and helps promote games that swing back and forth.\n\n“Looking at analogue card games in Japan in recent years, I think having some design elements that foster some sort of comeback or dramatic turnaround seemed really important,” says Lead Game Designer Naoyuki Miyashita, when I ask about the initial goals for the Evolution system. “Another problem with CCGs in general is that they tend to favour whoever plays first, so we wanted to make sure we included elements that would balance the win-ratio regardless of who plays first.\n\n“ “From the very start... we wanted to base the game rules around the Evolve function because... it helped to enable comebacks, and it helped to balance the game in spite of who starts first.\" - Naoyuki Miyashita.\n\n“From the very start of development,” he continues, “we wanted to base the game rules around the Evolve function because it balanced both of those things – it helped to enable comebacks, and it helped to balance the game in spite of who starts first.\n\n“Obviously the Evolve function itself evolved over time; it took about half a year to settle upon the design that made it into the final game. But that was the inspiration for the design.”\n\nThe idea that “Every card should evolve,” was one of three key points at the beginning of development, according to Miyashita. The others were that “the game should be accessible enough to play on a smartphone. And the game should be competitive enough to become a viable e-sport title.”\n\nIn terms of that second pillar, Shadowverse has since been released on PC, but – in Japan especially – its primary identity is as a smartphone game, and that means both limitations and opportunities to develop very specifically for the platform. “One key element” that sets Shadowverse apart from other CCGs and was driven by the platform, says Miyashita “is the length of time it takes for a battle, which is relatively short at just 5-10 minutes.” This has allowed the team to design some incredibly strong combo and late-game cards, so that matches don’t get dragged out for ages.\n\nThe fact that Shadowverse launched on mobile also didn’t constrain Cygames’ aspirations for it. “We want this to be a really long-term success,” says Kimura. “We want this game to be around in ten years. We want to make a game that people will talk about to their friends and colleagues. A real water-cooler game. And we really want it to be successful all over the world – not just in Japan. Magic: The Gathering was popular worldwide, so we hope that our game can emulate that.”\n\nHaving the right people is obviously crucial to realising that goal. “At the end of 2014 we started work on the game design with a team made up of myself and 3 CCG Designers,” says Miyashita. “We gradually increased the headcount in preparation for the game’s release in June of 2016, and we continued to recruit after the game’s release. Now we have about 20 people on the [Design] team.\n\n“While I oversee the overall design of the card game element itself,” he continues, “the CCG Design Team is divided into two groups. The CCG Designers are responsible for coming up with card designs (such as the features and abilities of new cards) while the CCG Playtesters test those new cards to make sure there are no problems. The majority of [the] team is made up of CCG Playtesters.”\n\nThese playtesters still use physical cards and physical systems to keep track of things like Play Points, Spellboosts and the like. It seems counter-intuitive for a game that was designed to incorporate, as Miyashita tells me, “features that could only work in a digital card game,” but it allows the team to iterate quickly. Plus, with so many experienced Magic: The Gathering players, there’s a history there with paper TCGs.\n\n“Experience with Magic: The Gathering is certainly one of the skills that we look for (we even have a previous Magic World Champion, Junya Iyanaga, on the team),” confirms Miyashita. “But we also have team members with experience of other digital card games, and we have RTS champions and pro MOBA players on the team too. The most important skill is the ability to analyse games, and the ability to express your own opinion clearly in reports to other parts of the development team.\n\nWith its team of veteran players and designers, Shadowverse has also been targeting its third key pillar – and another lofty goal – tournament play. “One major goal was to really invigorate the e-sports scene in Japan, and to come up with a title that could really sit at the heart of that scene,” Miyashita tells me. That plan has been in full swing for a while. “We have actually had to set up a whole team dedicated to supporting the community over here,” explains Kimura. “We provide support for independently organised tournaments, as well as running large-scale official tournaments like the JCG Shadowverse Open.\n\n“The game is already very successful as an e-sport in Japan,” Kimura says, “with an ecosystem that ranges from small-scale tournaments at hobby shops to large-scale offline tournaments with cash prizes and so on.” The home market is just the first stage, however. The team’s next goal is “to develop a similar sort of community outside Japan too. It would be great to have some sort of World Final, or International Cup to see players competing from all over the world.”\n\n“ “One major goal was to really invigorate the e-sports scene in Japan, and to come up with a title that could really sit at the heart of that scene.” - Naoyuki Miyashita.\n\nThe first step down that road for Shadowverse has been the North American esports league in partnership with NGE. From my perspective it feels like awareness of – and interest in – Shadowverse has been growing steadily, but there’s no doubt Japan is still the game’s heartland. “I think the ratio of players inside Japan to outside Japan is something like 5:1 at the moment,” confirms Kimura.\n\nThat’s a great base from which to grow, but there’s no doubt the CCG space is becoming ever more crowded in the West. Hearthstone continues to be a juggernaut, and now it’s joined by games like The Elder Scrolls: Legends, Duelyst and Faeria, with others, like Gwent, in beta. All of these games are competing for attention, which means that attracting and retaining new players is incredibly important. “We regard new players with the utmost of respect,” responds Miyashita, when I ask about the new player experience. “For any PvP game, having a lot of active users is of crucial importance, as it is for any successful e-sports title. And of course having a lot of active users depends on having a lot of new users. That’s why we try to reward players with a lot of card packs – for playing through the tutorial, for example, or when we launch new card expansions. We want new users and non-paying users to be able to enjoy the game just as much as we want to support users who have large card collections. We also added Prebuilt Decks made up of popular cards for new users who want to play with popular decks as soon as possible.”\n\nIt’s a refreshing approach, and if you’re like me - someone who came to the game with no real expectations – you may just find yourself still playing a year later; looking forward to the next influx of cards, and wondering what the future may hold for this unique card battler and its ambitious developer.\n\nCam Shea is senior editor in IGN's Sydney office and spends too much time obsessing over CCGs.

The question is when. But a recent clash between Uber, the ride-hailing giant, and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has cast some doubts on the future of self-driving technology and which company will profit from it. Waymo, Alphabet’s autonomous car unit, has sued Uber for appropriation of trade secrets and patent infringement. The result of the lawsuit could have big implications both for companies and consumers. What is behind the dispute, and which firm is likely to win out?\n\nThe problem can be summed up in one four-letter word: Otto. Last August Uber announced it had acquired a seven-month-old startup that specialised in autonomous lorries, called Otto, for around $680m. The young startup was co-founded by Anthony Levandowski, a veteran of Alphabet’s self-driving car efforts. According to Waymo’s lawsuit, filed in February, before abruptly resigning from Alphabet and founding Otto, Mr Levandowski stole around 14,000 proprietary documents, which has helped Uber replicate Waymo’s lidar technology. Lidar users lasers to scan surrounding objects and is employed in self-driving cars. Uber denies the allegations, says its lidar system is different than Waymo’s and suggests that Waymo is using this lawsuit to try to thwart the innovation and business of a rival.\n\nCourt battles, like divorces, rarely end with either party looking good. But in this instance Uber stands to lose the most. The conflict reinforces Uber’s reputation as a rough-and-tumble startup with a culture of winning at all costs. Mr Levandowski was in touch with Uber and lined up a potential acquisition before he even left Waymo, according to Waymo’s allegations, and Otto was acting merely as a shell company to funnel talent and intellectual property to Uber. Both companies’ programmes to develop autonomous technology will be affected by the outcome of this lawsuit, which could go to trial in October. Alphabet, which has been working on autonomous cars since 2009 and was a leader in the field, has recently found itself in fierce competition with other companies. If it wins the lawsuit, it could slow down Uber’s progress. The lawsuit has already hurt Uber’s ability to recruit top talent in autonomous cars, because the future of which technology it will use is in doubt. Waymo has asked the judge for an injunction, which would bar Uber from using lidar technology until the case is resolved. The judge is expected to make a decision on whether to grant an injunction soon.\n\nBut while a lot of attention will be paid to which company will win out in the lawsuit, it is also worth asking what this means for consumers. The arrival of reliable self-driving cars could herald a safer era for people, with fewer accidents and newly found time to accomplish things during commutes as opposed to staring at the road. Having more companies than Waymo work toward that future will bring about innovation and speed up the pace of progress. Whatever the result, ideally it is delivered quickly so everyone can get back to work.","author":"The Economist","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T15:00:00.000Z"},"source":"the-economist","urlToImage":"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20170506_BLP526.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"jwaTltS3KW4AQ8dC2V3oZA==\n"}

Le Pen suffered what appears to be a crushing defeat in Sunday’s election, but the far-right is not yet a spent force in Europe. (Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe anti-E.U. French leader Marine Le Pen’s larger-than-expected defeat Sunday in her nation’s presidential election was a crushing reality check for the far-right forces who seek to overthrow Europe: Despite the victories for Brexit and Donald Trump, they are likely to be shut out of power for years.\n\nGiven one choice after another since Trump’s U.S. presidential victory, Western European voters have delivered mainstream candidates to office despite a post-\n\nNovember sense that an anti-\n\nimmigrant populist wave was washing over the Western world. Far-right candidates in Austria, the Netherlands and France have faltered. The euroskeptic far-right party in Germany has collapsed in recent polls ahead of September elections. And an unforgiving election calendar now offers few routes into power for years.\n\nThe thwarted momentum comes despite clear evidence that views that would have been taboo to express just a few years ago are no longer too toxic to exclude politicians from coming a breath away from leadership. When Le Pen’s father reached a presidential runoff in 2002, his opponent refused even to debate with him, so unacceptable to the mainstream were his views. This time, many French citizens sat out the election altogether because they detested both Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron — even though the pro-European centrist Macron offered a vastly different platform from his opponent. Le Pen’s result, about 34 percent, was still a historic high for her party.\n\n“French people have chosen the continuity candidate,” a visibly disappointed Le Pen said in a brief concession address. She said she would seek to rename her National Front party, a measure of the extent to which her defeat rattled supporters who just weeks ago harbored hopes of capturing the Elysee Palace.\n\nInstead, Le Pen’s numbers sank in the two weeks since she placed second in the first round of the French elections.\n\n(Adam Taylor,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n\nNow the test for Europe’s future will be whether Macron can rekindle France’s relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel after it languished during the five-year term of France’s current president, François Hollande, whose popularity hit record lows. If France continues to stagnate, Sunday’s victory may turn out to be a five-year reprieve from the far-right rather than a decisive rejection of it.\n\nBut the failure of the far-right to seize office comes in stark contrast to expectations in November that Trump’s ascendancy in the United States would unleash a global wave of populist politicians. Le Pen was one of the first political leaders around the world to congratulate Trump the night of his victory. Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders exulted the day after. And Trump advisers and top European far-right leaders conferred in the weeks after the U.S. election.\n\nThe subsequent elections have shown a clear trend in Western Europe: Voters are sick of the mainstream and fed up with their leaders. But they are still not ready to hand power to the far-right. The chaotic first months of the Trump presidency may actually have hurt Europe’s populists rather than helping them.\n\n“This is what happens when the refugee crisis doesn’t dominate the headlines anymore and the right-wing populists are dismantling themselves,” said Josef Janning, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “It isn’t that simple after all to break Europe apart with nationalism.”\n\nIn Central Europe, right-wing nationalist leaders are in power in Poland and Hungary. But neither presents an existential challenge to the European Union as Le Pen did in France.\n\nEuropean leaders rushed to turn the page on a grim year for the bloc, embracing Macron’s victory as the first step in the rejuvenation of an embattled alliance against forces that would tear it apart. Many mainstream leaders feared political Armageddon if Le Pen had won. In Brussels, the seat of the E.U., cheers could be heard in the streets the moment the exit polls were released Sunday evening, as though a favorite soccer team had clinched a match.\n\n“The French clearly demonstrate that protest and a desire for change doesn’t always have to lead to the election of right-wing populists,” Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe far-right’s best hope for a victory may be Austria, where opinion polls suggest that the ­anti-immigrant Freedom Party may be able to lead a coalition after elections that must be held by next year at the latest. But the party’s presidential candidate lost an election in December, underperforming opinion polls ahead of the vote.\n\nIn Germany, meanwhile, the far-right Alternative for Germany has collapsed in opinion polls in recent months following post-Trump heights. The party presided over a smaller but still telling defeat on Sunday, bringing up the rear in Sunday’s vote in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, with projections showing it winning less than 6 percent of the vote. That result was far below the party’s strong showing in local elections last year and came as its support is flagging in Germany following a scandal in which one of its top members made controversial statements on Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust.\n\nMerkel’s Christian Democratic Union, meanwhile, easily came out on top in the state, projected to win nearly 33 percent of the vote.\n\nIn a Sunday night phone call with Macron, Merkel “recognized his espousal of a united and open European Union in the election campaign. The decision of the French voters therefore also was a clear commitment to Europe,” said Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert.\n\nAmid the celebration, there was acknowledgment that Macron’s victory may be just a temporary reprieve, since anti-E.U. forces remain powerful and growing in France. If the new French president fails to deliver on his promises by the next election in 2022, Le Pen or another anti-E.U. leader may return stronger than ever. Elsewhere in Europe, the euroskeptic Five Star Movement now tops Italian opinion polls ahead of elections that must be held before spring 2018, though it is not a far-right party.\n\nMacron hopes to soften Germany’s exacting insistence on fiscal austerity as he imposes sweeping pro-business reforms in his own country. If he succeeds, he may help disarm anti-E.U. voices across the continent. But if he fails to jump-start France’s economy — and Europe’s — he will fuel questions about whether the E.U. is helping or hurting citizens’ lives.\n\n“If the mood in France and Europe is the same five years from now it becomes impossible,” said Stefano Stefanini, a former senior Italian diplomat who now is a fellow at the Atlantic Council. “You cannot have forever a part of Europe that is growing and a part that is not.”\n\nWith so much at stake, Macron remains a largely unknown quantity: This was his first bid for elected office, and he has no political party behind him. German leaders hope Macron will prove to be a Gallic version of themselves, wagering that his finance background will lead to German-style economic changes.\n\nHe may yet be tempted, however, to answer the problem of France’s economic stagnation with more government spending. Should he move in that direction, Merkel would face a new and potentially potent challenge to German financial orthodoxy that has kept a lid on budget deficits — and economic growth — across the bloc.\n\nMany elements remain unsettled, most notably the extent of Macron’s leeway to impose his vision on his nation. His powers will be severely limited if he fails to capture a working majority of the French legislature in June elections. And Merkel faces elections in September.\n\nFaiola reported from Berlin.

(Thibault Camus/AP)\n\nThree years ago, hardly anyone knew his name.\n\nBut in a once-unimaginable scenario, Emmanuel Macron — at 39, the boy wonder of an aging political establishment — won the French presidency Sunday with a tidal wave of popular support. He will soon be France’s youngest head of state since ­Napoleon Bonaparte as well as its first modern president who does not belong to either of the center-left or center-right parties that have run this country for 60 years.\n\nAfter the Brexit campaign’s success in Britain and Donald Trump’s upset victory in the U.S. presidential election, ­Macron’s triumph was billed as having slowed the global tide of anti-establishment populism. In the vote’s second and final round, he defeated Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, an anti-immigrant party tainted by the perception that it is tolerant of anti-Semitism and Nazi nostalgia.\n\n“I will fight with all my strength against the division that is undermining and defeating us,” Macron said just after the results were announced. “For the next five years, I will serve on your behalf with humility, devotion and determination.”\n\nMacron’s story is of a highly improbable ascent in a system that typically rewards entrenched political dynasties.\n\n(Adam Taylor,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n\n“It’s entirely unprecedented in the Fifth Republic,” said François Heisbourg, a well-known French defense expert who has advised Macron on security and terrorism issues. “It’s extraordinarily unusual, the way he has broken through the system — coming from nowhere.”\n\n[Macron campaign says its emails have been subjected to “massive” hacking]\n\nMacron, who has never held elected office, has now been elected to one of the most powerful executive positions in the Western world and will be the leader of Europe’s second-largest economy. He did it, analysts say, through a combination of luck and a campaign message attuned to a new political moment.\n\nIn France, 2017 proved an ideal year to run as an independent candidate. A rare political vacuum emerged, and Macron — a former Socialist economy minister who stepped down from his post in July — was able to take full advantage.\n\nWith the public frightened by a slew of terrorist attacks by Islamist extremists, and with the unemployment rate in double digits, France’s Socialist Party, under President François Hollande, sank to historic levels of unpopularity. Hollande promised in December not to seek reelection, but his Socialist stand-in, Benoît Hamon, was eliminated in the election’s first round, winning a meager 6.35 percent of the vote.\n\nFrance’s mainstream conservative party, Les Républicains (the Republicans), was undermined by a spending scandal involving François Fillon, its contender. Once the undisputed favorite, Fillon suffered a fatal blow after Le Canard Enchaîné, a French satirical newspaper, accused him of funneling about 900,000 euros ($990,000) of public funds to his wife and children for work they never did.\n\nFrench President-elect Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, celebrate on the stage at his victory rally near the Louvre. (Philippe Wojazer/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nMacron perceived that the “new divide” among French voters was not between left and right but rather between an open and closed society, Heisbourg said.\n\nDefending an open, multicultural society was a central component of En Marche (Onward), the movement Macron launched in 2016. “Globalization can be a great opportunity,” he said at one point on the campaign trail. “There is no such thing as French culture,” he said at another. “There is culture in France, and it is diverse.”\n\nThe great French novels are often stories of ambitious young men from the provinces who come to Paris to seek their fortunes. For many, Macron is no exception. The literary son of doctors from provincial Amiens, he graduated from France’s elite École Nationale d’Administration, the traditional breeding ground of presidents.\n\nSome in the French news media have placed the first sign of Macron’s formidable ambitions in, of all places, his love life — namely, in his dogged pursuit of his wife, Brigitte, his former high school teacher and a woman 24 years his senior. As Brigitte Macron told a French documentary maker last year, “Bit by bit, he defeated all my resistance, in an amazing way, with patience.” The candidate showed the same persistence in capturing the Elysee Palace.\n\n[Macron is 39 and his wife is 64. French women say it’s about time]\n\n“I have known failures, sometimes bitter, but I have never allowed myself to turn away,” Macron wrote in his 2016 book “Révolution.”\n\nThat doggedness — along with a calculating eye for useful associations, critics say — brought him into contact with many prominent French thinkers and government officials, who then helped him advance.\n\nIn the late 1990s, while still a graduate student, Macron worked as an assistant to Paul Ricoeur, a prominent French intellectual and writer; by the mid-2000s, he was working for the Finance Ministry, on a commission dedicated to stimulating economic growth. It was there that he met Jacques Attali, a prominent economist and Parisian power broker who many say later ushered Macron along a speedy path to the highest echelons of the Hollande administration.\n\nIn an interview, Attali, who has also served as an adviser to the Macron campaign, rejected out of hand the idea that the candidate was mainly a gifted networker.\n\n“He would be where he is today with or without my help,” Attali said.\n\nIf Macron’s ambition has led him to considerable success, it has also earned him enemies — including, some say, Hollande, whom he served as economy minister but then abandoned to launch his party.\n\n“Emmanuel Macron betrayed me methodically,” Hollande said last year, according to the daily newspaper Le Monde.\n\nJean Pisani-Ferry, another Macron adviser and the author of much of the candidate’s platform, brushed off the comment.\n\n“He launched another politics, created a new movement. Political life wouldn’t exist otherwise,” Pisani-Ferry said in an interview.\n\nDespite the improbable nature of Macron’s victory, France’s new president will face a considerable challenge as he attempts to form a government. Given that he has no party structure behind him, he will be deeply affected by the results of the parliamentary elections, scheduled for June.\n\n“There is huge uncertainty regarding the parliamentary elections to come, because France’s main political forces were largely absent in the second round — the traditional right wing, the Socialists and the far left,” said Patrick Weil, a leading French legal scholar and historian. “Now they are frustrated, and they are ready to take their revenge in the legislative elections.”\n\nIn the past, when the National Front made it to the final round of the presidential election, the rest of the political spectrum united in opposition to the extreme right. But this year, certain politicians hesitated to back Macron in the final round — notably the far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Many voters also opted to abstain or to cast blank ballots.\n\n“You might have higher mobilization for the parliamentary elections than usual, which, given turnout in the presidential election, could mean a higher legitimacy for the parliament than for the presidency,” Weil said.\n\nRead more:\n\nA youth revolt in France boosts the far right\n\nThe dark history at the heart of the French election\n\nHow Merkel’s efforts to save Europe may lead to its undoing\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":"James McAuley, James McAuley","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T08:45:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/07/Foreign/Images/2017-05-07T220525Z_1299319083_RC14D948B290_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-ELECTION.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"xB+nuRwutG4icKhmsIFlWg==\n"}

Instead, her brief time in the job has fueled months of fierce political debate on the White House and Russia.\n\nOn Monday, Yates is to testify before a Senate subcommittee about her discussions with the White House, testimony that was delayed for more than a month after a previously scheduled appearance before a House committee was canceled amid a legal dispute over whether she would even be allowed to discuss the subject.\n\nLawmakers want to question Yates about her conversation in January with White House counsel Donald McGahn regarding former national security adviser Michael Flynn. People familiar with that conversation say she went to the White House days after the inauguration to tell officials that statements made by Vice President Pence and others about Flynn’s discussions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were wrong, and to warn them that those contradictions could expose Flynn or others to potential manipulation by the Russians.\n\nYates’s testimony Monday is expected to contradict public statements made by White House press secretary Sean Spicer and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who described the Yates-\n\nMcGahn meeting as less of a warning and more of a “heads up’’ about an issue involving Flynn.\n\nIn February, Spicer told reporters that Yates had “informed the White House counsel that they wanted to give a heads up to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict. . . . The White House counsel informed the president immediately. The president asked him to conduct a review of whether there was a legal situation there. That was immediately determined that there wasn’t.’’\n\nThe same month, Priebus described the Yates conversation in similar terms, telling CBS’s “Face the Nation’’ that “our legal counsel got a heads up from Sally Yates that something wasn’t adding up with his story. And then so our legal department went into a review of the situation. . . . The legal department came back and said they didn’t see anything wrong with what was actually said.’’\n\nPeople familiar with the matter say both statements understate the seriousness of what Yates told McGahn — that she went to the White House to warn them that Flynn could be compromised — or blackmailed — by the Russians at some point if they threatened to reveal the true nature of his conversations with the ambassador.\n\nThose people said that although Yates’s testimony may contradict Spicer and Priebus, her appearance Monday is unlikely to reveal new details about the FBI’s investigation into whether any Trump associates coordinated with Russian officials to meddle with last year’s presidential election, in part because many of the details of that probe remain classified. Former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. is also scheduled to testify at Monday’s hearing. Lawmakers had invited another Obama administration official, Susan E. Rice, to testify but she declined.\n\nRice, who served as Obama’s national security adviser, has been under scrutiny from Republicans who have suggested that she mishandled intelligence information involving Americans. President Trump said she might have committed a crime when she asked intelligence analysts to disclose the name of a Trump associate mentioned in an intelligence report, a practice known inside the government as “unmasking.’’ Rice has said she did nothing improper.\n\nBefore she became acting attorney general, Yates was the No. 2 official at the Justice Department in the final years of the Obama administration. Yates had spent decades in the Justice Department as a prosecutor in both Republican and Democratic administrations. Her brief tenure in the top Justice Department job ended days after her meeting with McGahn, when she was fired by Trump over an unrelated issue. She had instructed government lawyers not to defend the president’s first executive order on immigration, which temporarily barred entry to the United States for citizens of seven ­Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world.\n\nFlynn was asked to resign in February, after White House officials said he had misled Pence about the nature of his conversation with the Russian ambassador.\n\nAnticipation for Yates’s testimony has been building since March, when she was scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence Committee — a hearing that was canceled by the chairman, Rep Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). In the days before the originally scheduled hearing, Yates’s attorney, David O’Neil, had been locked in an argument with Trump administration officials about whether she would be barred by executive privilege from testifying about her conversation with McGahn.\n\nA week before the planned House hearing, O’Neil went to the Justice Department to discuss the issue of her testimony. That day, he wrote a letter to the department in which he said those officials had “advised’’ him that Yates’s official communications on issues of interest to the House panel are “client confidences’’ that cannot be disclosed without written consent. In his letter, O’Neil challenged that interpretation as “overbroad.’’\n\nIn response, a Justice Department lawyer wrote back that Yates’s conversations with the White House were probably covered by “presidential communications privilege,’’ and referred him to the White House. As O’Neil awaited a response from the White House, Nunes canceled the hearing, making the legal issue moot.\n\nAfter The Washington Post reported on the letters, Spicer said it was “100 percent false’’ that the administration had sought to block Yates’s testimony, and said he welcomed it.","author":"Devlin Barrett, Sari Horwitz, Devlin Barrett, Sari Horwitz","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T11:00:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/06/National-Security/Images/Trump_Russia_Congress_42766-956b8.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"itq1TX1jrsSGkOSfPVTtqQ==\n"}

The move is one step in the process of repealing Obama’s landmark health-care law.\n\nObama praised the courage of freshman lawmakers who voted for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, knowing that it might put their seats and political careers at risk. “These men and women did the right thing,” Obama said. “They did the hard thing ... and most of them did lose their seats.”\n\nAs the legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act moves to the Senate, Obama called on Republican and Democratic lawmakers to demonstrate similar courage to ensure that vulnerable Americans do not lose access to care.\n\n“This great debate is not settled but continues, and it is my fervent hope — and the hope of millions — that regardless of party, such courage is still possible,” Obama said. He did not explicitly call on senators to defend Obamacare, but rather he exhorted them to stand up for those who are most vulnerable.\n\n“I hope that current members of Congress recognize that it takes little courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential,” he said. “But it takes great courage to champion the vulnerable, the sick and the infirm” and those with “with no access to the corridors of power.”\n\nObama's speech marked the second time that he has weighed in on politics since leaving office. He was still on vacation in January when he issued a statement urging Americans to protest President Trump’s executive order banning citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries — as well as refugees from across the world — from entering the United States.\n\nObama also went out of his way to praise the courage of immigrants and “dreamers,” who came to the country illegally as children, and those who continue to protest injustices in the criminal justice system. As he frequently did as president, he singled out the bravery of soldiers, police officers and first responders.\n\nHis remarks about immigrants drew applause from the largely liberal crowd. Despite the deep partisan divisions in the country and its often toxic politics, Obama said that the problems Kennedy confronted as president were far more “perilous.”\n\nKennedy faced the prospect of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, deep and widespread poverty, and the battle over segregation. And he called on Americans to continue the country’s tradition of “jagged, sometimes tentative but always forward progress.”","author":"Greg Jaffe, Greg Jaffe","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T15:35:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-05-07/Getty/AFP_O74L8.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"ot8PQCulKeVkIbphADr1hw==\n"}

Charges against students present at the event were announced in Bellefonte, Pa. on May 5. (AP)\n\nAt first, Cordell Davis thought his fellow pledge had just had too much to drink, he said. They were new initiates to Beta Theta Pi fraternity at Penn State and had just run the gantlet — a series of stations where they guzzled beer, wine and vodka as fast as they could.\n\nBut Tim Piazza had fallen down a flight of stairs on that morning in February and was on a couch in the frat house, unresponsive. Davis said he thought he should be at a hospital instead, and told his new frat brothers so.\n\n“They said ‘No you’re overreacting. You don’t know what you’re talking about,’ ” Davis recounted in an interview on “Good Morning America” that aired Friday. “I said ‘I do know what I’m talking about. He could have a concussion.\n\n“They just wanted to make sure that they themselves were safe rather than Tim truly being safe.”\n\nDavis’s interview elaborated on what happened in the final hours of Piazza’s life. Authorities announced charges against 18 fraternity members on Friday, after a grand jury concluded that “the Penn State Greek community nurtured an environment so permissive of excessive drinking and hazing that it emboldened its members to repeatedly act with reckless disregard to human life.”\n\nEight fraternity members were charged with involuntary manslaughter. Other charges included hazing, aggravated and simple assault, alcohol-related violations and evidence tampering.\n\nThe chapter house was celebrating with Piazza, Davis and other students who had just accepted bids to join the fraternity. During the pledging party, Piazza fell down the stairs after drinking excessively, but no one called for help for almost 12 hours, according to police.\n\n\n\nTimothy Piazza, center, with his parents Evelyn Piazza, left, and James Piazza, right, during Hunterdon Central Regional High School football’s “Senior Night” at the high school’s stadium in Flemington, N.J.

Several times, Piazza tried to stand but fell, hitting his head.\n\n[She wanted to criticize Black Lives Matter in a college speech. A protest shut her down.]\n\nAt about 1 a.m., fraternity brothers put a backpack full of books on Piazza, who had thrown up and was twitching, in an attempt to keep him from rolling onto his back, according to the grand jurors’ findings. After 3 a.m., Piazza tried to stand but fell, hitting his head on the floor. He fell again at 4 a.m. At 5 a.m., he fell, hit his head on an iron railing and landed on a stone floor.\n\nHe got up, trying to get to the front door, but fell and hit his head on the door. Fraternity brothers stepped over him, according to the findings. After 7 a.m., Piazza fell down the basement stairs again. When fraternity members found him, unconscious, cold to the touch, and with blood on his face the next morning, it was more than 40 minutes before they called 911.\n\nWhen police were finally summoned, they rushed Piazza to the hospital, but he died the next morning.\n\nIn the wake of Piazza’s death, Penn State President Eric J. Barron permanently banned the fraternity. In a statement, he called the details in the indictment “heart-wrenching and incomprehensible” and announced beefed up regulations for fraternities and sororities.\n\nIn the statement, he said that the fraternity chapter where Piazza died had been a model for others:\n\n“Both the Beta alumni and the national organization provided strict rules of behavior; and, the brothers had a no alcohol policy which stated that anyone caught drinking would be expelled.”\n\nRead more:\n\nTexas police officer who killed black teen could spend rest of his life in prison\n\nSan Diego police kill 15-year-old who pointed a BB gun at officers\n\nThe most common punishment for killing a journalist in Mexico: Nothing\n\nDelta says pilot who struck a passenger was trying to break up a fight","author":"Cleve R.

(Justin Merriman/Getty Images)\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has chosen to replace half of the members on one of its key scientific review boards, the first step in a broader effort by Republicans to change the way the agency evaluates the scientific basis for its regulations.\n\nThe move could significantly change the makeup of the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors, which advises EPA’s key scientific arm on whether the research it does has sufficient rigor and integrity. All of the members being dismissed were at the end of serving at least one three-year term, although these terms are often renewed instead of terminated.\n\nEPA spokesman J.P. Freire said in an email that “no one has been fired or terminated,” and that Pruitt had simply decided to bring in fresh advisers. The agency informed the outside academics on Friday that their terms would not be renewed.\n\n“We’re not going to rubber-stamp the last administration’s appointees. Instead, they should participate in the same open competitive process as the rest of the applicant pool,” Freire said. “This approach is what was always intended for the Board, and we’re making a clean break with the last administration’s approach.”\n\nBut the move came as a surprise to members of the board, who had been informed both in January, before Barack Obama left office, and then more recently by EPA career staff members, that they would be kept on for another term.\n\n“I was kind of shocked to receive this news,” Robert Richardson, an ecological economist and an associate professor at Michigan State University’s Department of Community Sustainability, said in an interview Sunday.\n\nRichardson, who tweeted on Saturday, “Today, I was Trumped,” said that he was at the end of an initial three-year term on the board, but that board members traditionally have served two such stints. “I’ve never heard of any circumstance where someone didn’t serve two consecutive terms,” he added.\n\nCourtney Flint, a professor of natural resource sociology at Utah State University who had served one term on the board, said in an email that she was also surprised to learn that her term would not be renewed, “particularly since I was told that such a renewal was expected.”\n\n“In the broader view, I suppose it is the prerogative of this administration to set the goals of federal agencies and to appoint members to advisory boards,” she added.\n\n[EPA just buried its climate site for kids]\n\nRyan Jackson, Pruitt’s chief of staff, noted in an email that all the board members whose terms are not being renewed could reapply for their positions.\n\n“I’m not quite sure why some EPA career staff simply get angry by us opening up the process,” he said. “It seems unprofessional to me.”\n\nPruitt is planning a much broader overhaul of how the agency conducts its scientific analysis, said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The administration has been meeting with academics to talk about the matter and putting thought into which areas of investigation warrant attention from the agency’s scientific advisers.\n\nThe agency may consider industry scientific experts for some of the board positions, Freire said, as long as these appointments do not pose a conflict of interest.\n\nConservatives have complained about EPA’s approach to science, including the input it receives from outside scientific bodies, for years. Both the Board of Scientific Counselors and a larger, 47-person Scientific Advisory Board have come under criticism for bolstering the cause for greater federal regulation.\n\nSen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), who questions the link between human activity and climate change and has several former aides now working for Pruitt, said in an interview earlier this year that under the new administration, “They’re going to have to start dealing with science and not rigged science” at EPA.\n\nHouse Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) held a hearing on the issue in February, arguing that the composition of the Scientific Advisory Board, which was established in 1978, should be expanded to include more non-academics. It is primarily made up of academic scientists and other experts who review EPA’s research to ensure that the regulations the agency undertakes have a sound scientific basis.\n\n“The EPA routinely stacks this board with friendly scientists who receive millions of dollars in grants from the federal government,” Smith said at the time. “The conflict of interest here is clear.”\n\nIn a budget proposal obtained by The Washington Post last month, the panel is slated for an 84 percent cut — or $542,000 — from its operating budget. That money typically covers travel and other expenses for outside experts who attend the board’s public meetings.\n\nThe reasoning behind the budget cut, said the document, reflects “an anticipated lower number of peer reviews.”\n\nChris Mooney contributed to this report.","author":"Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis, Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T16:27:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/04/29/Production/Daily/A-Section/Images/668169314.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"Wi8f6GGzJwB0exSU4YYtkg==\n"}

Lee statue in New Orleans at a demonstration on May 7. (Annie Flanagan for The Washington Post)\n\nNEW ORLEANS — At Lee Circle, an intersection less than a mile from one of the Mississippi River’s snaking bends through this city, local legend has it that the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee stands, arms folded, facing north so as to keep an eye on his adversaries.\n\nOn Sunday, some of those adversaries marched in a second-line parade to the traffic circle where Lee’s statue stands — centurion-like, stationed above the treeline atop a white stone pedestal — to protest the monument’s place in the circle and to bury Lee’s place in history, which some revere and others revile. They were met by Confederate-flag wavers keeping vigil there, some wearing riot gear or motorcycle helmets.\n\nThe tense meeting came amid a debate about the future of the 130-year-old monument to the Confederate army leader. In December 2015, after days of public discussion, the New Orleans City Council voted to remove the Lee monument and three others honoring the Confederacy from prominent public spaces around town. Proponents of the memorials mounted a legal fight to save them, but lost.\n\n[After a lost court battle, New Orleans protesters launch last-ditch effort to protect Confederate monuments]\n\nMayor Mitch Landrieu (D) has vowed to remove Lee’s statue and two other prominent memorials — one to Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard in City Park and another of Confederate president Jefferson Davis in a greenway in the Mid-City neighborhood — in short order, as soon as this week, by some reports. But city officials have refused to provide precise dates, because of threats made against contractors involved in removing the statues. When the Battle of Liberty Place monument, a memorial honoring those who died in an attempt to overthrow the city government after the Civil War, came down two weeks ago, contractors did the work in the middle of the night wearing kevlar and face masks.\n\n“The time surely comes when (justice) must and will be heard,” Landrieu told the council in 2015, explaining why he and others believed the statues must go. “Members of the council, that day is today. The Confederacy, you see, was on the wrong side of history and humanity.”\n\nOn Sunday, the scene remained largely nonviolent. Three people were arrested, all men defending the monuments and charged with disturbing the peace after getting into a skirmish. At Lee Circle, there was some yelling between the pro-monument and anti-monument crowds and some icy stares. Much of the fury and the verbal challenges came from the monument defenders, who appeared to be outnumbered by the second-line participants by at least two to one.\n\n\n\nPeople advocating for the removal of symbols of white supremacy march in New Orleans on Sunday. (Photo by Annie Flanagan for The Washington Post)\n\nFor them, the statues are a symbol of an inhumane regime and the ideology that has helped to sustain racial and economic inequality.\n\n“These are symbols and, as such, we recognize only a much-needed part of the struggle toward social and economic justice. But symbols are used to bind people in the present,” said Angela Kinlaw, who spoke at a rally before the parade.\n\nSome of the men and women defending the monuments gathered near Davis’s statue dressed in biker leathers embellished with American and Confederate flags. One man wore a Donald Trump jacket. At least two men headed toward the Davis vigil site carrying a confederate flag carried sticks and wore visible sidearms.\n\n[‘The Battle of New Orleans’: David Duke expects Confederate statue defenders to mass on Sunday]\n\nNew Orleans native Nick Carroll was in place near the Davis monument well before noon, stationed behind metal police barricades and near a series of Confederate and U.S. flags. Nearby were signs describing Landrieu as a king and the decision to remove the statues as evidence of tyranny.\n\nCarroll, who said two members of his family left New Orleans to fight for the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg, was there to protect the memorials. On Monday, progressive activists hurled bottles and eggs at monument defenders, he said.\n\nA Vietnam veteran, Carroll said he was confronted many times when he returned to the United States by people who referred to him as a terrorist, a baby killer and other insults challenging the legitimacy of the war. So, he said he resents suggestions that Confederates were traitors and war criminals who waged war for an inhumane cause. He believes those men were good people, men of valor whose legacy is at risk.\n\n“I think these anti-fa people want to wipe men like this away,” said Carroll, using a term short for “anti-fascist” that some on the right prefer for progressives and those opposed to President Trump. Carroll, who was born and raised in New Orleans, said, that “they want to bury them in shame and dishonor all because they chose to focus on one little bit of their stories and what they supposedly did to people. These were good men. And I think if it starts here and is not stopped this kind of thing will move on to the Washington Monument, the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C., next.”\n\nAbout a mile away in Congo Square, Ian Hoch, who paraded in the second-line, held a sign that read: “Murder, Torture, Rape Cool Heritage Bro.” When asked about Carroll’s sentiments, Hoch stared incredulously.\n\n“That’s not how these people, these Confederates are being recast, that’s who they were,” Hoch said. “These were terrible people. That’s reality. Maybe they did a few nice things for people after the war. Maybe Robert E. Lee wrote his wife a letter saying he loved black people, but at that point, it’s just lipstick on a pig. They were part of an evil regime defending the indefensible.”","author":"Janell Ross, Janell Ross","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T16:02:00.000Z"},"source":"the-washington-post","urlToImage":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/08/Others/Images/2017-05-07/20170507_Flanagan_0003.JPG","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"p6nQvUeXjD5+8VN8iehwlw==\n"}

People pull up to the front door, park next to a gleaming antique ambulance and enter a waiting room that feels more like a graceful hotel lobby than a holding area for sick people.\n\nIt isn’t a clinic or an urgent care — it’s an emergency room, without the hospital.\n\nWhen lawyer Richard Yount opened the facility, called Elite Care Emergency Center, in 2009, the idea was simple: Emergency rooms were crowded, with miserable waits and rushed doctors. He could fix that — and make a lot of money — by carving the department out of the hospital, putting it in a neighborhood where people without insurance were ­unlikely to show up and charging hospital-level prices.\n\nThere was just one problem: People assumed it would be cheap, especially at first. “No matter how many times you tell people you’re an emergency room, they have a tendency to think: If you’re in that kind of an environment, you’re an urgent care,” said Yount, who now operates four free-standing ERs.\n\nFree-standing ERs, stand-alone facilities where people can receive acute care any time of day, have increased in Texas in recent years as a result of a 2009 law that permitted the establishment of emergency rooms independent of hospitals. They join a host of other on-demand facilities — including hospital ERs, hospital-owned satellite ERs, “microhospitals” and urgent-care facilities — where people can receive care, especially if they have robust health insurance.\n\nTexas’s wild west of competition, with lit-up signs advertising “SHORT WAIT TIME FOR LACERATIONS” and highways punctuated by warring billboards, is a leading example of how an emerging wave of convenient medical-care options for Americans can also create confusion and lead people to seek expensive treatment for conditions that might not merit it, pushing up costs across the health-care system.\n\nAcross 32 states, more than 400 free-standing ERs provide quick and easy access to care. But they also are prompting complaints from a growing number of people who feel burned by ­hospital-size bills, like $6,856 for a cut that didn’t require a stitch or $4,025 for an antibiotic for a sinus infection.\n\nEmergency care requires costly imaging and laboratory equipment and facilities that are open 24 hours a day and staffed round the clock by a physician — and the costs reflect that. Prices for an average free-standing ER visit have grown and are now similar to hospital ERs, but patients with the same diagnosis rack up bills 10 times higher than at an urgent care, according to an analysis of one insurer’s Texas data by Rice University economist Vivian Ho. She found use of the facilities in Texas more than tripled between 2012 and 2015.\n\nThe high cost raises the question of whether people are seeking out more expensive care only because it’s convenient, not because it’s necessary.\n\n“If there had not been a close, convenient emergency department, would that person have gone to an emergency department, or sought care somewhere else?” said Jeremiah Schuur, an emergency medicine physician at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital who studies the industry.\n\nTexas’s flowering of free-standing ERs leads a debate about whether convenience makes people healthier or needlessly drives costs up — a central dilemma in health-care innovation. Health-care specialists want people to seek care that’s necessary. But with U.S. health-care spending surpassing $3 trillion this year, new attention is focused on how making health care a better consumer product might simply increase its use. Research shows, for example, that walk-in retail health clinics and telephone medicine, which might seem to ­replace more expensive options, actually tend to slightly drive up health-care spending.\n\n“The vast majority of people who get sick on a monthly basis don’t go get care, don’t even think about getting care — and among those who do think, ‘I should go get care,’ only two-thirds of them end up getting a visit of some type,” said Ateev Mehrotra, a physician and researcher at Harvard Medical School who did that research. “There is an enormous market of people out there who . . . choose to get care when it’s convenient.”\n\nTexas’s crowded landscape of ERs and clinics may seem like a consumer paradise, in which people are able to shop around. But it lays bare a simple truth: It’s hard to shop when no one knows what anything costs.\n\nBryan Piccola of Frisco, Tex., sliced his left pointer finger on July 4 when his knife slipped cutting tightly wound zip ties off a toy for his year-old daughter. He debated cleaning the wound up and sticking a bandage on it, but he went to a free-standing First Choice Emergency Room a few miles from his house. He asked beforehand how much it would cost, since he is a veteran and didn’t have separate insurance, and says he was assured it wouldn’t be too bad. He received five stitches and, later on, the bill: more than $5,000. The company discounted it to $2,888.\n\n“You drive by them all the time. There’s a bunch of these little pop-up clinics,” Piccola said. “If they would have told me [how much it would cost], I wouldn’t have gone — I’d have gone home and wrapped it up and waited for the scar.”\n\nAdeptus Health, the company that owns First Choice Emergency Room, declared bankruptcy in April. It declined a request for an interview.\n\n‘Money just fell in your lap’\n\nRichard Yount embarked on his career as an emergency room entrepreneur as Texas’s access to emergency care was hitting rock bottom, given a failing grade by the American College of Emergency Physicians. He had watched other hospital services, such as imaging centers, being spun into separate, lucrative businesses.\n\n“You had not a lot of competitors and you had all the patients you’d ever want, and they paid a lot. Money just fell in your lap,” Yount said. “I watched this train go by for 30 different services, and I only caught onto the caboose.”\n\nYount’s insight was simple: In addition to the physician’s bill, hospitals were paid a “facility fee” to cover X-rays, CT scanners, laboratories, and round-the-clock staffing by physicians and nurses. Free-standing emergency rooms shared many of these costs, since they strive to deliver the same care available in a hospital ER, and the facility fee made the business viable.\n\nBy situating in well-off neighborhoods, they could largely avoid patients who couldn’t pay. Without a hospital affiliation, they cannot bill Medicare or Medi­caid for emergency care, and many carry warnings on the front door that they do not accept those less-lucrative plans. And as a start-up, the free-standing ERs weren’t encumbered with the high administrative costs of a hospital.\n\nComplicated cases, such as surgeries or trauma, could be sent by ambulance to a hospital, but stand-alone emergency room operators argue they can see people faster, keep them out of the hospital altogether and save money.\n\nYount, 68, is a jumble of contradictions. He is an unapologetic capitalist who operates four free-standing emergency rooms in Texas and is in the process of finding a site in Las Vegas to build a “microhospital” — an ER with some inpatient beds.\n\nHe is also a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and a strong believer in universal health care whose office is still decorated with light-blue signs from Sanders’s presidential campaign.\n\n“I can believe in one thing on a macro level, as to what this country needs to do. But if I want to operate, I’m operating within the current system that we have. So I make the economic decisions based on the current system we have,” Yount said. “Doesn’t mean I have to like the current system — and I don’t.”\n\nYount says the start-up costs are about $5 million. In the early days, the business could break even with just seven or eight patients a day. The break-even point today is up to eight or nine, and Yount expects the number to rise as pressure from insurers increase.\n\nThe model appeals to many physicians and nurses.\n\n“The mind-set is totally different here,” said Aaron Schwartz, an emergency physician at Elite Care. “In the hospital, it’s driven by surveys and scores, efficiency and throughput times and volume. . . . We can spend as long as the patients want us to spend with them.”\n\nSome patients appreciate the convenience. Miguel Balli, 24, of Houston had spent a miserable night, vomiting and ill, when he showed up at Elite Care one Monday morning. Within an hour, he was getting an IV drip and beginning to feel better.\n\n“These setups are a lot more beneficial for the patient as far as time concern and quickness and availability,” Balli said. “If you’re not the most serious person at the ER, if you’re not the one bleeding out or having a heart attack, you’re probably going to get last on the totem pole.”\n\nA ‘misleading’ factor on costs\n\nThe problem is the flip side of the success: People who would have thought twice before navigating down to Houston’s crowded medical hub, the world’s largest medical center, have a surfeit of options right in the neighborhood.\n\nIn Sugar Land, an affluent suburban city south of Houston, there is St. Michael’s Emergency Center, right next to Emerus 24HR Emergency Hospital, a former free-standing ER that’s been converted into a small hospital. In the driveway, two identical signs look like mirror images, each directing people with an “EMERGENCY” in a different direction. A mile away, in both directions, are two hospitals.\n\nThe ease of access is a good thing if it is moving people to seek care for symptoms that would be dangerous to ignore.\n\nMany free-standing emergency room operators say they do their utmost to stress to people that they are in an emergency room, with emergency room prices, and they refer patients with minor conditions to urgent-care facilities. The buildings have “emergency” signs on them and are required by state law to carry written warnings that they will charge a facility fee — although the amount is not disclosed.\n\nBut Ho of Rice University has found a big overlap in the types of conditions for which people seek care: Three-quarters of the 20 most common diagnoses at free-standing ERs were the same as at urgent-care centers. A slightly smaller overlap existed for hospital-based emergency rooms.\n\n“It’s fine if it generates the value of the price that is paid, but if it’s not generating that value, then all it does is raise costs for everybody,” Ho said. “There needs to be more transparency in terms of the cost. Why should it be comparable to what a hospital ER is charging?”\n\nBut even as free-standing emergency rooms defend themselves, the model appears to be evolving, in part in response to the confusion. Yount provided a tour of what he says is the future: a large free-standing ER that stands apart from shopping malls and wouldn’t easily be mistaken for an urgent-care clinic. One of his competitors, Emerus, switched to building “microhospitals.”\n\nFree-standing ERs blame insurers for big bills, arguing they deny claims or underpay them. Insurers, in turn, blame the facilities for charging high prices.\n\n“There’s this misleading factor, or I’d go so far as to say deception,” said Shara McClure, a vice president at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. “A member who’s having an incident, having an acute condition, they go into these free-standing ERs thinking they’re a cost-effective solution.”\n\nThe Texas legislature is considering bills that would help protect consumers from surprise bills and regulate the industry.\n\nThat points to the biggest lesson emerging from Texas’s experiment.\n\n“We need to do more to make prices extremely visible to patients,” said Schuur, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “But it also calls into question the ability of patients to be smart consumers, particularly in the time when they have what they perceive as an acute health-care need.”","author":"Carolyn Y.

The final trailer, shown during tonight’s MTV Movie Awards, follows Gal Gadot’s Diana as she crosses over from the land of Themyscira to our world, retrieving her iconic whip and shield along the way.\n\nStepping into our plane of existence, she finds herself embroiled in World War I, meeting up with American pilot Chris Pine and stepping into battle in France. Gadot’s impressive superpowers have a natural home in the midst of combat, but as the trailer shows, she might be less used to polite 1910s society, where women were expected to wear the kind of restrictive clothes that made high kicking tricky. We’re still a month out from Wonder Woman’s premiere, but the trailers have also shown that DC has expanded its color palette somewhat for the new movie, using some brighter and sunnier shades alongside its standard blue-and-grey color schemes.","author":"Rich McCormick","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T02:08:11.000Z"},"source":"the-verge","urlToImage":"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_KRoylkQjUtsN8flox0fbIN38A=/15x0:1971x1100/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54666119/wonder_woman.0.jpg","class":"Media","digest":"vaZ1xQ1K89xPydezDsThEQ==\n"}

And Mr. Macron quickly made clear that he understood the magnitude of the task before him after an often angry campaign.\n\nVideo\n\n“It is my responsibility to hear and protect the most fragile,” he said.\n\nWith nearly 100 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Macron had 66 percent, compared with 34 percent for Ms. Le Pen, according to the official count from the Interior Ministry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe outcome was a watershed for Ms. Le Pen’s party, the far-right National Front, giving it new legitimacy even though the results showed that the party remains anathema to much of the French electorate for its history of anti-Semitism, racism and Nazi nostalgia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs significant for France and for Mr. Macron’s future, nearly 34 percent of eligible voters did not cast a ballot or cast a blank or null one, suggesting that a large number of people could not bring themselves to vote for him. The abstention rate was the highest since 1969.\n\nThat lack of support presaged a difficult road ahead as Mr. Macron tries to build a legislative majority to push through his program. French parliamentary elections are next month. Currently, he has no party in Parliament.\n\nAmong the odds stacked against Mr. Macron, a former economy minister in the departing Socialist government, are deep doubts about the merits of a market economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We saw the emergence of very strong anticapitalist forces,” said Gaspard Koenig, the director of the French think tank Generation Libre.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“You have 50 percent of the electorate that reject the market economy in a very radical way,” Mr. Koenig added. “Thus, he must during the next five years convince people that there are alternatives to the destruction of capitalism that can help them.”\n\nThe runoff election was groundbreaking for being a choice between two political outsiders, as well as for its rancor and for an apparent attempt to sway the vote with the hacking of Macron campaign emails, similar to the attack directed at last year’s election in the United States.\n\nMs. Le Pen, 48, conceded the election not long after polls closed in France, saying voters had chosen “continuity,” denying Mr. Macron his outsider status and linking him to the departing Socialists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe vote was a record for the National Front and, she said, a mandate for it to become a new “patriotic and republican alliance” that would be “the primary opposition force against the new president.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Le Pen earned 10.6 million votes, close to twice the number her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, received when he ran a losing presidential campaign against Jacques Chirac in 2002.

Stéphane Ravier, a National Front senator and a close adviser to Ms. Le Pen, said the party needed to go further in remaking its identity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We will need to make some changes, do things differently,” he said in an interview as the returns came in. “We will have to talk about our positions on the euro with more pedagogy.

There was an official French media blackout on sharing the specific contents of the hacking before the vote, and the troves of data did not appear to have had a large impact on the election’s result.\n\nLinks to zip and torrent files were posted under the profile of someone called EMLEAKS on Pastebin, an anonymous publishing website.

It will presumably take experts weeks to sift through and assess all the leaked documents. Experts suspect a Russian-linked espionage operation known as A.P.T. 28, or Fancy Bear, may be involved, although there is no firm evidence that the operation was behind the thefts. European and American analysts have determined that the group was responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee in the United States.\n\nMr. Macron’s party has been targeted by hackers since last year. Last month, Trend Micro, a cybersecurity firm, said that a hacking group believed to be a Russian intelligence unit had attacked Mr. Macron’s campaign, sending emails to campaign officials and others with links to fake websites designed to bait them into turning over passwords.","author":"The New York Times","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T23:48:38.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/08/world/08France-what-to-watch-for-sub/08France-what-to-watch-for-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg","class":"Politics \u0026 Government","digest":"Zm/h1g1Rhkt/SANaPq4ARA==\n"}

Mr. Washmon, who is white, was part of a group of protesters waving Confederate flags who had been attracting both honks of support and invectives from passing cars all afternoon. Like Mr. Stewart, he feared that removing the statues would deprive a history-laden city of a crucial layer of its past. “It’s a travesty,” Mr. Washmon said.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn December 2015, Mr. Landrieu, a Democrat who will leave office next year because of term limits, signed an ordinance calling for the removal of four monuments related to the Confederacy and its aftermath. It was six months after Dylann Roof, a white supremacist with a fondness for Confederate symbols, massacred nine black people in a church in Charleston, S.C. One of the monuments, an obelisk honoring a violent uprising in 1874 by white New Orleanians who rejected Reconstruction, was taken down on April 24 by workers wearing flak jackets and scarves to conceal their identities.\n\nThe unease has only grown since then. Mr. Landrieu has said that the city plans to remove the remaining three monuments — first the statue of Davis, then those of two Confederate generals, P. G. T. Beauregard and Robert E. Lee — over the next month or so, though he has not announced exact dates. Last week, the statue of Beauregard was slathered in red paint by vandals. And Confederate sympathizers and fans of the statues have been flocking to the city from as far away as New Mexico and Colorado to protest their removal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Monday night, defenders of the statues squared off against a large group of opponents near the Davis statue in the Mid-City area. “Get the hell out of New Orleans,” the multiracial group of opponents sang, to the tune of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” using much stronger language, “because you’re not wanted here.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe police arrested five people on charges of disturbing the peace and other infractions, and city officials have surrounded the statue with barricades and police guards. But the crowds continued to gather, and some defenders of the statues have come heavily armed. A man who referred to himself only as K. K. walked along a median on Tuesday carrying an AK-47, with a Glock handgun on his waist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Landrieu has said the city is sticking to the plan, though it appears that will not be easy. Removing the remaining statues will require the use of a heavy crane, and the mayor told The Times-Picayune that every crane company in the region had received threats.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, anti-statue protesters numbering 500, according to police estimates, took to the streets in a boisterous second line parade through the French Quarter and downtown, ending at Lee Circle, the roundabout where the Lee statue is. There, they faced off against about 150 protesters who had come from all over the country in a show of support for the statue. Some of the counterdemonstators brandished Confederate battle flags. Some exhibited Pepe the Frog insignia and other trappings of the so-called alt-right, a fringe movement that embraces white nationalism. And some wore improvised battle gear, including bike helmets, shin guards and homemade shields.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the New Orleans Police Department had erected barriers to separate the two groups. Louisiana is an open-carry gun state, but police officials had warned that guns would be banned at Sunday’s protest, citing a city ordinance. One local man had brought large speakers that he used to crank out pop tunes, including Abba’s “Dancing Queen,” a soundtrack that helped transform the proceedings from ominous to farcical.\n\nPhoto\n\nBeau Tidwell, the communications director for the Police Department, said that three people were arrested Sunday for disturbing the peace over minor scuffles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, the rising tensions came at an awkward time for the city, and for the mayor. This is the season when the New Orleans Jazz \u0026 Heritage Festival takes center stage, showing off to thousands of tourists the glories of Louisiana’s musical multiculturalism and its deep ties to Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America and the white rural South.\n\nFor Mr. Landrieu, who declined to be interviewed, the trouble also underscores the difficulties he has faced in meeting his goal of bringing racial harmony to New Orleans. The city is 60 percent black and 33 percent white, and it is burdened by severe economic disparities.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The current mayor, who enjoys some of that good will, said in a statement in late April that the statues would be moved to a museum “or other facility where they can be put in context,” and thus show the world that New Orleans celebrates “diversity, inclusion and tolerance.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe statement also noted that the statues were erected decades after the end of the war and were meant to “demonstrate that there was no sense of guilt for the cause in which the South fought the Civil War.”\n\nWesley Lynch III, a 25-year-old African-American, said the gesture was an important one. Mr. Lynch was standing by the flag-wavers near the Davis statue on Thursday, having encountered them after paying his light bill at the nearby power company office. He is unemployed — his last job was at a Popeyes chicken restaurant — and he spoke, with passion and despair, about the statues not as relics, but as living symbols of a social order that, from his experience, wanted people like him to rise only so far.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“They’re putting that image right in our face and saying, ‘Blacks at the bottom, whites at the top,’” he said. “That’s what they’re saying.”\n\nPhoto\n\nThe supporters of the statues run the gamut. Among them is David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who has run for office several times in Louisiana. Rather predictably, he sees the removals as “destroying our heritage” and has called Mr. Landrieu “a traitorous cuck,” deploying a slur used by white nationalists and the alt-right to insult politicians as weak and unmanly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are many, however, like Mr. Stewart, who profess no love for either white supremacy or slavery. Mr. Stewart said the statues serve as a reminder of society’s evolution away from such noxious ideas — proof, he said, that “we have come a long way from our ancestors.”\n\nA number of the statue supporters keeping vigil by the Davis monument agreed with that sentiment, adding that they did not believe the Civil War had been fought over slavery. “It really was an economic issue,” K. K., the man with the AK-47, said on Tuesday.\n\nOthers said they worried that the removals would create a slippery slope. Where would it end, they asked? Would a statue of George Washington be next?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuch concerns were unlikely to be assuaged by Mr. Suber, an adjunct professor of political science at Southern University, an avowed Marxist-Leninist, and an organizer of an anti-statue group called the Take ’Em Down NOLA Coalition. He noted that he had been part of a group that persuaded the Orleans Parish School Board to pass a policy in 1992 that prohibited schools from being named for slave owners. It eventually led to a school called George Washington Elementary being renamed for Dr. Charles Richard Drew, a prominent black surgeon.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Suber chuckled mischievously and said he would be delighted to see the statue of Washington over by the New Orleans Public Library come down, too.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“He was a slave master,” he said. “Right?”","author":"Richard Fausset","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T04:48:34.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/07/us/08MONUMENTS1/08MONUMENTS1-facebookJumbo.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"10UwS3qFLmTY3JKjpXYAtA==\n"}

Although most residents believe Mr. Rosselló had no choice but to seek some sort of protection from the flurry of lawsuits that had already begun, others have criticized him for breaking a campaign promise.

But the Bellagio gets about three times as many check-ins on Facebook.\n\nThe search for online status takes some peculiar twists. Facebook works with an outside company to gather data on the cars people actually own. Facebook also has data on the cars people associate with by posting about them or by liking them.\n\nOwners of luxury cars like BMWs and Mercedeses are about two and a half times as likely to announce their affiliation on Facebook as are owners of ordinary makes and models.\n\nIn the United States, the desire to show off and exaggerate wealth is universal. Caucasians, Asian-Americans, African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans are all two to three times as likely to associate on Facebook with a luxury car they own than with a non-luxury car they own.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut different people in different places can have different notions of what is cool and what is embarrassing. Take musical taste. According to 2014 data from Spotify Insights on what people actually listen to, men and women have similar tastes; 29 of the 40 musicians women listened to most frequently were also the artists most frequently listened to by men.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Facebook, though, men seem to underplay their interest in artists considered more feminine. For example, on Spotify, Katy Perry was the 10th most listened to artist among men, beating Bob Marley, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and Wiz Khalifa. But those other artists all have more male likes on Facebook.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe pressure to look a certain way on social media can do much more than distort our image of the musicians other people actually listen to.\n\nSufferers of various illnesses are increasingly using social media to connect with others and to raise awareness about their diseases. But if a condition is considered embarrassing, people are less likely to publicly associate themselves with it.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

But migraine sufferers have built Facebook awareness and support groups two and a half times larger than I.B.S. sufferers have.\n\nNone of this behavior is all that new, although the form it takes is. Friends have always showed off to friends. People have always struggled to remind themselves that other people don’t have it as easy as they claim.\n\nThink of the aphorism quoted by members of Alcoholics Anonymous: “Don’t compare your insides to other people’s outsides.” Of course, this advice is difficult to follow. We never see other people’s insides.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI have actually spent the past five years peeking into people’s insides. I have been studying aggregate Google search data. Alone with a screen and anonymous, people tend to tell Google things they don’t reveal to social media; they even tell Google things they don’t tell to anybody else. Google offers digital truth serum. The words we type there are more honest than the pictures we present on Facebook or Instagram.\n\nSometimes the contrasts in different data sources are amusing. Consider how wives speak about their husbands.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn social media, the top descriptors to complete the phrase “My husband is …” are “the best,” “my best friend,” “amazing,” “the greatest” and “so cute.” On Google, one of the top five ways to complete that phrase is also “amazing.” So that checks out. The other four: “a jerk,” “annoying,” “gay” and “mean.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile spending five years staring at a computer screen learning about some of human beings’ strangest and darkest thoughts may not strike most people as a good time, I have found the honest data surprisingly comforting. I have consistently felt less alone in my insecurities, anxieties, struggles and desires.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce you’ve looked at enough aggregate search data, it’s hard to take the curated selves we see on social media too seriously. Or, as I like to sum up what Google data has taught me: We’re all a mess.\n\nNow, you may not be a data scientist. You may not know how to code in R or calculate a confidence interval. But you can still take advantage of big data and digital truth serum to put an end to envy — or at least take some of the bite out of it.\n\nAny time you are feeling down about your life after lurking on Facebook, go to Google and start typing stuff into the search box. Google’s autocomplete will tell you the searches other people are making. Type in “I always …” and you may see the suggestion, based on other people’s searches, “I always feel tired” or “I always have diarrhea.” This can offer a stark contrast to social media, where everybody “always” seems to be on a Caribbean vacation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs our lives increasingly move online, I propose a new self-help mantra for the 21st century, courtesy of big data: Don’t compare your Google searches with other people’s Facebook posts.","author":"Seth Stephens-Davidowitz","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-07T01:47:50.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/07/opinion/sunday/07seth/07seth-facebookJumbo.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"pnpxFsaqtMFTUAaZCO2LPQ==\n"}

She said the project in Jersey City “means a lot to me and my entire family.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kushner has said he has stepped back from the day-to-day operations of the family business. But government ethics filings show that he and Ivanka Trump, his wife and the president’s daughter, continue to benefit from their stake in Kushner Companies’ real estate business and other investments, which is worth as much as $600 million.\n\nThe Shanghai event, at the opulent Four Seasons Hotel, was patrolled by burly security guards who screened those in attendance and kept journalists outside, in an elevator lobby. The organizers had refused on Saturday to allow late registration as word spread of the Beijing event. One guard at the Shanghai event was heard saying that at least some of the participants would be leaving through a private back exit.\n\nBut some who attended described an investor pitch similar to the one in Beijing, and Mr. Trump’s political power was palpable at the Shanghai event even if his name went unsaid. As on Saturday in Beijing, one slide that was presented to the Shanghai audience, describing who will decide the future of the visa program for foreign investors, included a photograph of Mr. Trump, as shown by a snapshot taken by an audience member.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKushner Companies’ marketing push comes as Mr. Kushner is emerging as a crucial voice on China relations, brokering meetings between his father-in-law and top Chinese government officials.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile the Trump connection piqued the interest of many people in attendance, such events soliciting investors for projects in the United States are not unusual in China. The so-called EB-5 visa program awards foreign investors the right to live in the United States for two years and a path to permanent residency, in exchange for investments of at least $500,000 in American development projects. A bright red line near the top of the posters in the Four Seasons lobby prominently mentioned EB-5 visas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout three-quarters of the roughly 10,000 investor visas issued last year went to Chinese nationals.\n\nAlthough the program was created as a way to finance projects in economically troubled neighborhoods, it has instead turned into a form of cheap financing for luxury real estate developers. Applicants are primarily seeking the visa, so they typically do not seek a significant return on their investment.\n\nThe United States Government Accountability Office, the investigative branch of Congress, has criticized the visa program for its lax safeguards against illicit sources of money.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He divested his interests in that project by selling them to a family trust of which he is not a beneficiary, said Blake Roberts, a lawyer at WilmerHale who is advising Mr. Kushner on ethics issues.\n\nMr. Kushner has divested his stakes in dozens of entities used to hold family company investments, although he remains the beneficiary of trusts that hold stakes in hundreds of others.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Ms. Meyer wanted to make clear that her brother had stepped away from the company in January and has nothing to do with this project,” said Risa Heller, a Kushner Companies spokeswoman. “Kushner Companies apologizes if that mention of her brother was in any way interpreted as an attempt to lure investors. That was not Ms. Meyer’s intention.”\n\nMany in China start looking for overseas residency and passports after they have children. They fear the effects of smog on their children’s lungs — the smog was heavy in Shanghai on Sunday, and an internationally comparable index of air quality showed that the pollution was seven times the level in New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany families also consider overseas schools to be preferable to those in China, where ferocious academic competition keeps children doing homework until late at night even in elementary school, in preparation for a national college entrance exam that can be the difference between riches and ruin.\n\nMs. Bi, who is 34 and is expecting her first child, said, “I want my child to live in a relatively relaxed environment where he or she could be himself or herself and lead a diverse life, instead of having no choice but to take the college entrance exam in China.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, she said, investing in the Kushner project would not give her and her husband enough time to get to the United States before her baby was born.\n\nMany people in China worry that the window for obtaining an EB-5 visa may be closing.

He has said he will take a tough line on immigration, although he did not take aim at investors in real estate projects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Kushner project promoted to Chinese investors, called Kushner 1, includes two towers and nearly 1,500 luxury apartments, with construction to begin early next year.","author":"Keith Bradsher, Ailin Tang and Jesse Drucker","publishedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-08T04:36:32.000Z"},"source":"the-new-york-times","urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/07/world/08KUSHNER/08KUSHNER-facebookJumbo.jpg","class":"Economic \u0026 Corp","digest":"sfntRavn+fTIM8U/2718RQ==\n"}
